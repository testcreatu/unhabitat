Kilagal was one of the neighbourhoods in the historic core of Kathmandu knocked down in last year’s earthquake but, in rebuilding, the municipality may be destroying the community once again — this time its precious cultural heritage.

Many of the ancient houses and courtyards of Kilagal (or Kilagha) suffered serious damage and were declared unfit to live in. The brick buildings with carved wooden windows — set in a warren of narrow alleys — were home to Jyapu and Vaidya families who had been living here for generations.

One such neighbourhood, Dambo Chok, has now been singled out by the Kathmandu Metropolitan City(KMC) for house pooling: rebuilding safer houses while concurrently addressing the problem of high urban density. KMC has approved a Rs 50 million plan, and 54 houses in Dambo Chok have presented a joint application for land acquisition to the Kathmandu Valley Development Project (KVDP) for approval.

After last year’s earthquake there was a call to “build back better”, and the KMC proposed an urban regeneration initiative for inner-city Kathmandu, with residential blocks, wider roads and open spaces. The idea was that areas such as Kilagal would be better prepared for future earthquakes, and the plan would solve the problem of property fragmentation due to inheritance.

In Kathmandu Valley’s old towns, historic homes are often torn down, to be divided up among brothers and then re-divided among their children and grandchildren. The average land area of a home in Kilagal is now only 9 sq m, tiny rooms in thin concrete towers that rise 13 stories high. KMC — in collaboration with the National Society for Earthquake Technology (NSET) — therefore planned to redesign entire neighbourhoods, not just one house at a time.

“Given the fragmentation of property and cramped living conditions, especially after the earthquake, house pooling was the best solution,” explained Bau Raja Maharjan of a committee overseeing reconstruction at Dambo Chok. He denies the plan would desecrate the physical and cultural heritage, since the temples and the bahals would be integrated in the plan.

While most Kilagal families are happy that their homes will be made of stronger concrete structures, some say the KMC’s house pooling plan will destroy the original architecture of the neighbourhood as well as its fragile culture and heritage.

“We tried to explain to the residents why it is important to use traditional building techniques and materials like brick and mud mortar, but we failed,” Kilagal resident Chandra Maharjan told us. “These neighbourhoods have immense heritage value but when you build the houses with concrete, it will all be worthless.”

The debate goes to the heart of how preservation of the heritage of cultural towns must go hand-in-hand with their modernisation and commercial usage, says Padma Sundar Joshi of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN Habitat).

He says: “A pati might have traditional value but if you look at it commercially, it might just be a waste of space. It’s important to understand the links between tangible space and intangible space in traditional architecture. If you cannot protect space, traditional footprints are destroyed.”

Kathmandu’s breakneck urbanisation is already eroding the substrate of the Kathmandu Valley civilisation, and public pressure for modern concrete housing, especially after the earthquake, has made it more difficult to argue for heritage preservation.

“For an outsider, a courtyard is just another courtyard but to those living there, each nook and cranny has an important meaning,” Joshi explains, “a part of it could be the space for Mahadev, or might have a specific function during festivals like Gunla. Even the lanes carry significance: the wider ones were for auspicious ceremonies, while narrower alleys were used for death rituals.”

House pooling would alter not just the design of buildings but also how these traditional practices and rituals are carried out, and questions their continuity. Josh says house pooling need not be bad as long as the buildings are designed “horizontally” and respect traditional spaces.

There are also legal issues. Nepal’s property law states that a landowner is entitled to the plot on which the house stands. Since there are no laws that prohibit vertical property division, there may be a problem if people who have their houses pooled do not want to live in them anymore.

KMC says the Dambo Chok plan is a ‘pilot’ project and, depending on how it goes, the formula will be replicated in other courtyards in Kathmandu Valley. Preliminary plans for Vaidya Chok have already been drafted and eight families have handed over their land ownership certificates as approval for the project. The challenge will be to simultaneously balance the needs of residents, the necessity for the structures to be seismic-resistant, and to address urban density and property fragmentation.

<strong>Joshi Complex</strong>

A decade ago, nine families of Khichapokhari’s Joshi clan got together to pool their houses. The reason: to accommodate an ever-growing kin. A private construction company was hired to erect a large apartment block called the Joshi Complex, which was built over what used to be nine courtyards with traditional and cultural significance.

The residential block was leased to a company for ten years, and when the lease ran out a dispute arose among family members who all wanted their slice of property back. The land was cut up into little pieces, resulting in vertical fragmentation of the property. The Joshi Complex, which was an experiment in house pooling, has disappeared, replaced by individual concrete houses standing on what used to be a precious legacy of Kathmandu Valley’s unique architectural and cultural heritage.

<strong>Kilagal</strong>

Historically, Kilagal has played an important role in Kathmandu’s many colourful festivals, especially Indra Jatra. The name comes from the words kisi (elephant) and ghar (house). Kilagal is where the traditional pulukishi for Indra Jatra is constructed, and the men from Kilagal enact the wild elephant dance on the street. The neighbourhood also has a figure of a red elephant looking down (above) on the busy main street from the second floor of one of the houses.\

<strong>House Pooling</strong>

The Kathmandu Metropolitan City has approved a budget of Rs 50 million for Kilagal’s pilot house pooling project (pictured above), under which residents will be given concessional loans for rebuilding their section of the complex. This means that the residents will give up their houses and pool resources to build a large housing area, where they will be provided with living spaces nearly the same in size as their previous homes. However, they will have to share the cost of building the internal and external infrastructure, such as the foundation, walls, beams, staircases and plumbing.

To date, plans to compensate families whose homes lie within the project area but are unaffected, are unclear.

554,5/23/2012 12:07,"UN-HABITAT has developed a checklist for mainstreaming gender under the second phase of Cities and Climate Change Initiatives (CCCI) initiated by UN-Habitat in 20 cities of 13 countries. The check list is being tested in different countries and Nepal (Kathmandu Valley) is one of those few countries chosen by UN-HABITAT. The purpose of testing the tool is (a) to test, tailor and disseminate the gender and climate change checklist in the context of Kathmandu Valley (b) to disseminate the findings to the stakeholders for adaptation of the toolkit to mainstream gender in climate change initiatives.

The checklist had been tested in Kathmandu valley varying from policy makers to local authorities and even incorporated valuable inputs from the communities with specific focus on women and their respective experiences and concerns.

To share the findings of the tested checklist, a dissemination workshop was organized on 10<sup>th</sup> April 2012 in Kathmandu bringing together individual experts and those participated in the interaction, representatives from, all the five municipalities in the Kathmandu Valley and representatives from civil society organizations and grassroots organizations and the government. The major objectives of this gathering are:
<ul>
	<li>Sharing the findings and way forward at national, municipal and neighborhood level and validate the findings,</li>
	<li>Receive feedback  on the findings and for UN-HABITAT to move ahead</li>
</ul>
The objectives of the dissemination workshop were achieved to a greater extent. For example (a) the findings from the test, reflections and suggestions were shared (b) a very good feedback received on the presentations and way forward for UN-HABITAT. The most exciting part of this workshop is that it is actively participated by ranges of representation from policy makers to implementations to grass-root women groups. This forum provided avenues to share the concerns and issues from multi dimensional perspectives opening door to new avenues.

This interaction on findings of the testing of the tool kit on Impact of Climate Change on Gender is not a beginning and end in itself. Addressing the meeting Ms. Meena Khanal, Joint Secretary of Ministry of Environment thanked UN-Habitat to bring in such an important issue and urged the participants to focus on gender perspective particularly impact on women health. In the climate change initiatives women should not be limited to passive receivers but they should be involved in the process giving them leading role. Ms. Ang Dawa Shrepa, Honble’ member of Constitution Assembly highlighted the situation of women in Nepal and called for a gender-focused action while building climate resilient society.

The workshop provided insights for UN-HABITAT to build upon what has been done so far and contribute in addressing the impact of Climate Change on Gender. As suggested by the participants the findings need to be a rolling document and fine-tuned further so that it can be validated at all level. Similarly, the toolkit need to be finalized with wider consultations as suggested, translated into Nepali and other regional languages so that it can be understood and applied with ease at all level for benchmarking the impact of Climate Change on Gender and plan actions to minimize the impact on gender at all level.",Climate Change and Gender Intiatives in Nepal,publish,climate-change-and-gender-intiatives-in-nepal,4/8/2014 12:09

नेपाललाई सन् २०१७ सम्ममा खुला दिसामुक्त बनाउने लक्ष्यअनुरूप कास्की, चितवन, तनहु“, म्याग्दीलगायतका १५ जिल्लाले घोषणासभा सम्पन्न गरिसकेका छन् । ‘हाम्रो गौरव हाम्रो स्वाभिमान खुलादिसामुक्त अर्घाखा“ची हाम्रो अभियान’ भन्ने नाराका साथ अघि बढेको अर्घाखा“चीलाई सम्भवतः मङ्सिरको दोस्रो साताभित्रै खुला दिसामुक्त घोषणा गरिने ग्लोबल स्यानिटेसन फन्ड अर्घाखा“चीका संयोजक विष्णु दवाडीको भनाइ रहेको छ । दवाडीका अनुसार खुला दिसामुक्त बन्ने अन्तिम प्रक्रियामा रहेको बाजुरालाई उछिन्न सकेमा अर्घाखा“ची जिल्ला नेपालको सन्दर्भमा १६औ“ स्थानमा रहनुको अलावा लुम्बिनीमा पहिलो खुला दिसामुक्त जिल्ला बन्ने बुझिएको छ । नगरपालिकाको घोषणापश्चात् ३५ गाविसमध्ये सन्धिखर्क नगरपालिका, ढाकावाङ र पोखराथोक गाविस मात्र खुला दिसामुक्त घोषणा हुन बाकी रहेका भए पनि आगामी शुक्रबारभित्रै सबै कार्य सम्पन्न हुने उनको दाबी रहेको छ

जिल्ला खानेपानी, सरसफाइ तथा स्वच्छता समन्वय समितिले २०६९ साउन ९ गतेको बैठकमा सन् २०१४ भित्रै खुला दिसामुक्त घोषणा गरी जिल्लाको सरसफाइ रणनीतिक योजनामा अगाडि बढ्ने अग्रिम लक्ष्य तय गरेको थियो । ०६८ सालको जनगणनाअनुसार ४६,८२६ घरधुरी रहेको अर्घाखा“चीमा करिब ३५ प्रतिशतमा मात्र सुरक्षित चर्पीको पहु“च रहेको र ३६ प्रतिशतले असुरक्षित खाल्डे चर्पी प्रयोग गर्नुको अलवा बा“की २९ प्रतिशतले खोल्सा, झाडी,बाटोघाटोजस्ता स्थानहरूमा नै दिसा गर्ने गरेका थिए । साउन २०६९ देखि ग्लोबल स्यानिटेसन फन्डको सहयोगमा नेस्ट नेपाल÷सिसेक अर्घाखा“ची र इकार्डस् नेपाल÷प्रागद्वारा अर्घाखा“चीका ४२ मध्ये ३२ गाविसमा पूर्ण सरसफाइ प्रवद्र्धन तथा खुला दिसामुक्त अभियान सञ्चालन गरेका छन् । त्यसैगरी २०६९ चैतदेखि यूएन हेबिट्याटको सहयोगमा इकार्डस् नेपाल÷प्राग अर्घाखा“ची र लुम्बिनी सामाजिक विकास केन्द्रद्वारा बा“की रहेका १० गाविसमा पूर्ण सरसफाइ प्रवद्र्धन तथा खुला दिसामुक्त अभियान सञ्चालन गरेका छन् ।

पहिलो चरणका ३२ मध्ये १२ गाविसलाई र दोस्रो चरणका १० मध्ये आठ गरी कुल २० गाविसलाई २०७१ असार १५ भित्रमा खुला दिसामुक्त घोषणा गर्ने उनीहरूको लक्ष्य भए पनि निर्धारित समयभित्र २५ वटा गाविसले खुला दिसामुक्त घोषणासभा गरेको सर्वविदितै रहेको छ ।

२०७१ जेठको दोस्रो साता गाविससचिवहरू र राजनीतिक दल तथा नागरिक समाजको कार्यशालाले चर्पी निर्माणकार्य सम्पन्न गरी जिल्लालाई असोजभित्र घोषणा गर्न सकिने अनुमान गरेको थियो । सोही कार्यशालाको समीक्षा र सहभागीहरूको प्रतिबद्धतालाई मध्यनजर गर्दै जेठ २० गते बसेको समन्वय समितिको बैठकले असार मसान्तभित्र बाकी रहेका १४ गाविसले चर्पी निर्माणकार्य सम्पन्न गर्ने, भदौभित्र अनुगमन र घोषणाको कार्य सम्पन्न गर्ने र असोज ३० मा जिल्लालाई खुला दिसामुक्त जिल्ला घोषणा गर्ने लक्ष्य निर्धारण गरेको थियो । लक्ष्य जस्तोसुकै लिएको भए पनि सरकारी निकायहरूको कार्यव्ययस्ता, किसानहरूको खेतीपाती लगाउने समय, वर्षात्जस्ता कारण चर्पी निर्माणकार्य सम्पन्न हुन सकेनन् । यद्यपि भदौदेखि चर्पी निर्माणकार्यमा तीव्रता देखियो ।

मानिसलाई बिहान उठ्नेबित्तिकै जानुपर्ने पहिलो स्थान चर्पी नै हो । तर, चर्पी निर्माण र प्रयोगसम्बन्धी सामाजिक जागरण र बानी–व्यवहार परिवर्तनको पाटोमा लाग्ने अठोट भने धेरै स्थानीयमा सकारात्मक देखिए पनि असोज ३० गतेभित्र जिल्लालाई खुला दिसामुक्त घोषणा गर्ने लक्ष्य भने प्रक्रिया पूरा नभइसकेको कारण सम्भव हुन सकेन । कात्तिक २१ भित्रमा बा“की गाविसलाई खुला दिसामुक्त घोषणा गर्नुका साथै खुला दिसामुक्त जिल्ला घोषणा गर्नका लागि क्षेत्रीय खानेपानी, सरसफाइ तथा स्वच्छता समन्वय समितिबाट अनुगमन गरिने योजना रहेको छ । अनुगमन भइसकेपछि प्राप्त प्रतिक्रियाका आधारमा जिल्ला खानेपानी, सरसफाइ तथा स्वच्छता समन्वय समितिको तत्काल बैठक बसी जिल्ला घोषणा समारोहको मिति तय गरिने कुरा जिविस सन्धिखर्कले जानकारी गराएको छ

सुरुवातमा जिल्लामा रहेका विद्यालयका शौचालयहरू दुर्गन्धित र केही प्रयोगविहीन अवस्थामा रहेका भए पनि हालका दिनहरूमा शौचालय र अन्य सरसफाइमा धेरै सुधार आएको कारण विद्यार्थीमा झाडापखाला,जुका, आउ“मासी, रगतमासी, टाइफाइडजस्ता रोगहरू लाग्न कमी भएको जनस्वास्थ्य अधिकृत लीलाराम गौतमको भनाइ रहेको छ । गौतमका अनुसार जिल्लालाई स्वस्थ राख्न यही माघभित्र पूर्ण खोपयुक्त जिल्ला बनाउने अभियानमा स्वास्थ्यकर्मीहरू सहरदेखि गाउ“सम्म परिचालन गरिएको कारण हालसम्म सात गाविस पूर्ण खोपयुक्त घोषणा भइसकेका छन् । यसै महिनाको अन्तिमसम्ममा थप १० गाविस खोपयुक्त घोषणाको प्रक्रियामा रहेको गौतमको भनाइ रहेको छ । चर्पी प्रयोग,साबुनपानीले हात धुने बानीको विकास, फोहोरमैलाको उचित व्यवस्थापन, सुरक्षित खाना र पानी पिउने बानीको विकास,घरआगन तथा गाउ“टोलको सरसफाइमा नियमितता, गर्भवती महिलालाई नजिकको स्वास्थ्यचौकीमा सुत्केरी गराउनुपर्ने,जन्मिएको बच्चालाई आवश्यकीय खोपहरू समयभित्रै लिनुपर्ने, कुपोषण हटाउनका लागि ‘हरेक बार खाना चार’जस्ता मानवजीवनस“ग महत्वपूर्ण कार्यहरूमा अगुवाइ गरेका सरसफाइसम्बन्धी अभियानकर्ता र जनस्वास्थ्यका कर्मचारी तथा स्वयम् सेविकाहरूलाई भ्याइनभ्याई बनेको छ ।

माथिका सबै कुरालाई गहिरिएर बुझेका नेपाली काङ्ग्रेस जिल्ला सचिव वाशुदेव आचार्यका अनुसार खुला दिसामुक्त र पूर्ण खोपयुक्त जिल्ला घोषणा गर्नु आफ“ैमा जटिल कार्य भए पनि जिल्लावासीहरूको सचेतना र एक–आपसको सद्भावका कारण कार्यक्रम सफल हुन लागेको बताएका छन् । ‘राज्यको नीतिभन्दा पनि गाउ“लेको थिति बलियो हुन्छ’ भन्ने मान्यताअनुरूप नीति–नियमहरू राम्रा भए पनि कार्यान्वयन गर्न–गराउन सकिएन भने समाज परिवर्तन हुन सक्दैन । अनि परिवर्तनको शुभारम्भ अरूबाट नभई आफै“बाट गरिनुपर्छ, सामूहिक प्रयासबाट असम्भव लागेको कार्य पनि सम्पन्न गर्न सकिन्छ र सफलता हासिल गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने कुराको राम्रो उदाहरण आफूलाई खुला दिसामुक्त र पूर्ण खोपयुक्त घोषणा गर्दै केही दिनभित्र अर्घाखा“चीले दिने निश्चित भइसकेको । जुन आफै“मा प्रशंसनीय मान्न सकिन्छ ।

The four day long training has been organized by UN-Habitat and its partners for raising awareness   on sustainable housing services and technologies that are currently being practiced at national as  well as international level and also to exchange idea from the European experience of the green  and sustainable technologies.

Speaking during the inaugural session Chief Guest of the program Mr. Kishor Thapa, Secretary at the Ministry of Urban Development highlighted the importance of new technology as well as the old traditional technology of Nepal that were actually the traditional Green technologies.

“Our technology should be continually improved, the traditional technology should be made more efficient with the new ones,” Thapa said.

He added that the technology of Green Homes should be taken to the ground level such that there is wide social acceptance of it as that is where the real change will begin.

He also informed about building an administrative hub soon at Babarmahal that will be using all the green technology and the concept of the green homes.

Likewise, Mr. Suresh Prakash Acharya, Joint Secretary at the ministry of Urban development said that the concept of Green Homes brings the notion that it is only environment friendly but in actual it goes beyond it as it deals more with human life style, health.

“We had this technology for ages and these are really beneficial we have to move towards the green technology that we have been using for the ages,” Acharya added.

Senior Program Officer at the European Union, Mr. Ranjan Prakash Shrestha also highlighted the importance of the Green Homes and praised the step of Green Homes in promoting sustainable housing and promoting Green Economy in Nepal.

The keynote speaker at the workshop, Dr. Ogenis M. Brilhante fromInstitute for Housing and Urban Development Studies, Netherlands shared the concept of Green Homes in the European context and highlighted the importance of the need of the to share his views on Green Homes.

Giving his remarks on the occasion, Mr. Shambhu KC, Director General from DUDBC revealed that the department has been promoting the concept of the Green Homes and its technology and has also produced “Green Technology Directives”.

Also speaking at the occasion, Habitat Program Manager and team leader of the Green Homes Project, Mr. PS Joshi briefed about the concept of the Green Homes project and also highlighted the importance of the green technology in the Nepali context.

Green Homes or Sustainable Housing is an approach that includes household systems that reduce pressure on natural resources and carbon emissions, thus resulting in human wellbeing, social equity, and green economy. The project is funded by European Union and implemented by UN Habitat and its partners.

The project was started in March 2013 and is being implemented in collaboration with World Vision Advocacy Forum (WVAF), its technical collaborator Rajdevi Consultants and local level CBOs Sagarmatha Community Development Centre (SCDC) in Morang, Indreni Social Development Forum (ISDF) in Nawalparasi and Sundar Nepal Sanstha (SNS) in Surkhet. In June 2014 UN-Habitat attended different consultative meetings and workshops at the field level in the three districts which was attended by respective Chief District Officer, Local Development Officer, members of the District Level Land Use Implementation Committees, local peace committees, heads of different government organizations, NGOs, civil society organizations, representatives of political parties, local intellectuals and journalists. At the VDC and Ward level consultations large number of local people including women and janjatis did participate in addition to farmers, local party members, local CBOs, intellectuals and teachers. During the different meetings 462 persons attended 186 (40%) of whom were women. Interest for land use planning as a means to mitigate many of the problems in land management being faced by development strategists and local people was observed. Also the media- local FM and newspapers- widely covered the activities. The project has been successful in elevating lot of interest in land use planning and the importance of a participatory approach in taking up sensitive issues like land both at the central and local levels. Ministry of Land Reform and Management requested to incorporate National Land Use Planning at the very beginning of the project which was accommodated. Currently, after the lapse of the mid-term phase of the project, local stakeholders in Surkhet have expressed interest to cover the whole of the valley or at least incorporate Uttarganga VDC for local level planning. UN-Habitat values people’s interest and is seriously considering how this could be accommodated within the limitations of time and resources.

Bhaktapur district, which includes 16 Village Development Committees (VDCs) and two municipalities, has also become the first district supported by GSF Programme in Nepal to be declared as ODF. Bhaktapur district has a total of 16 VDCs and 2 municipalities.

Hailing the success as a positive step towards attaining the universal access to water and sanitation service by 2017, President Yadav said the ODF declaration of Bhaktapur is an important emblem for the urban areas in Nepal.
Around 400 delegates and WASH activists, including ministers from Nepal, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and the Maldives participated in the conference.

Before the conference a team from India and Pakistan also visited GSF programme areas in Sindhupalchowk and an interaction programme was organized on 21 October in Bhaktapur to share the learning from the GSF programme in the region. Within South Asia, GSF is currently being implemented in India and Nepal, and is in the process of being expanded to Bangladesh and Pakistan.
During the closing session of the SACOSAN, Interim Election Council Chairman Khil Raj Regmi said “all the countries from the region should make sincere effort for the strict implementation of the commitments made from the conference.

The conference ended with a Kathmandu Declaration, in which the Heads of the delegation from all Eight SAARC countries unanimously agreed and committed to an open defecation free South Asia by 2023 and to progressively move towards sustainable environmental sanitation.

<strong>Land ownership</strong>

Issues related to land have existed for centuries around the world, and Nepal is no different. Land issues are frequent topics of discussion as well as trigger of disputes. They are believed to be one of the root causes of the 10-year-long conflict that plagued the country. Most land issues are legacies of history, while some new issues have emerged as a consequence of the conflict. Nepal is now healing itself from the wounds of hostility that destroyed much infrastructure, disrupted many minds, and dislocated many homes and locations.

During the insurgency there were at least 6,200 cases of then Maoist rebels seizing land from people they regarded as “wealthy landlords” and distributing the same to those they regarded poor. In a few instances, even the state seized land from the owners for one reason or another. In many areas, the seized properties have been returned through different mediations. But no authentic record exists so far. At least 7,700 cases of transactions of ownership were carried out by the Maoist mechanism in five districts of mid-western region alone, which are not recognized by legal authorities. To add fire to the fuel, land records have been partially or completely destroyed in many district offices, which aggravates the question of security of tenure. While the major concern should be to address broader issues on land, post–conflict land issues also demand resolution.

Undoubtedly, Maoist conflict raised a lot of awareness among the people, and at the same time raised expectations of the marginalized and poor of getting land. Due to limitations of the resource and ever growing population, it may not be practically possible for everybody to own a piece of land. A balance between the newly created expectations and the practical considerations is a challenge to the judicious management of land. It must be addressed if the country wants sustainable peace.

Land reform programs are not new in Nepal. For the first time it was initiated in the year 1964 to bring about judicious distribution of agricultural land and improve the living conditions of the actual peasants. But even after more than 50 years of its implementation, the program has been stagnant and has not yielded desired results. The decade-long conflict complicated the problem. Additionally, Nepal is an agriculture-based country, where agriculture employs more than two-thirds of the total population, non-farming employment opportunities are few and far between.

The average land holding per household in Nepal is about 0.7 hectare, which remains below the FAO recommendation of at least 0.9 ha to be economically viable. A deeper look at the distribution of land ownership shows seven percent of the households virtually landless (with less than 0.1 ha each) and 47 percent households holding less than 0.5 ha each. This explains why the competition for access to land and shelter has historically been a major source of conflict in the country.

History gives proof of the same. Inequalities and landlessness have existed since ages. The concept of Hindu Varna system based upon occupation extended to caste system, and many menial job-holders, mainly dalits, grew to become deprived of land. Many other vices like a feudal system of land tenure, and uneven agriculture labor like kamaiya, haliya, kamlari also took roots in Nepali society. The long history of non-democratic regimes like the Rana and the Panchayat rule deprived people of even the fundamental civil rights; and awareness of land rights was a far cry. On top of that, historically women have been denied adequate ownership of land and property. Only 19.7 percent of women have ownership of fixed assets at present. Other major problems are absentee landlordism, acute fragmentation of land parcels, and unplanned and haphazard land use practices which deplete productivity as well as total agricultural produce.

Land offices throughout the country have over 28,000 applications related to land registration pending. Of all the cases submitted for resolution at the district courts of Nepal, 60 percent are civil cases and about half (47.5 percent) of them are related to land litigation. Due to heavy work-load, and the courts being general courts—not specialist land tribunal courts—timely disposal of land cases is almost unheard of.

This indicates that land administration and land management system in the country are not sufficiently equipped to address the issues. The cumbersome manual processes of land survey and recording and land registration is prone to a multitude of errors, contributing to more potential conflicts. The system of archival, storage and security of records is weak beyond doubt. The available infrastructure and human resources are not capable of handling a fool-proof land administration system. Therefore, a total intervention to improving land administration and land management is the need of the day.

Major historical steps such as the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the Interim Constitution of Nepal have identified issues of land, as have the manifestoes of all major political parties. These documents have placed due attention to scientific land reform. The Ministry of Land Reform and Management has already identified 13 areas of commonality, including minimizing inequitable distribution of land, tenancy rights and land ownership and so on.

Likewise, the United Nations Development Assistance Framework for Nepal 2013-17 has also recognized establishment and implementation of an independent and impartial property dispute mechanism in regard to conflict-related property issues. It has pushed for addressing land issues with Nepal Peace and Development Strategy 2010-15. The potential areas for support are actions on property return and land reform, and independent inventory of property seized during and after the conflict.

In this regard, Catalytic Support on Land Issues project has been initiated jointly by the IOM, UNDP and UN-Habitat. It is funded by the UN Peace building Fund, a global UN multi-donor trust fund supported by over 50 international donors and managed through the UN Peace Fund for Nepal. This planned intervention will focus on the five major areas of land: policy negotiations, land use planning, regulatory framework, land information system, and capacity building. The project is in an initial phase of implementation. The planned two years intervention should be taken as a testing ground for devising appropriate concepts for a long term intervention to address and resolve diverse land related issues in Nepal.

523,12/19/2013 14:56,"Kathmandu, December 18, 2013 — A Workshop on Retro-maintenance Assessment Toolkits for School and Hospital Safety was held in the capital Kathmandu to disseminate the findings of  the Multi-hazards Retro-maintenance Assessment Toolkitsof Schools and Hospitals on Wednesday. The Toolkits for School and Hospital Safety was developed by UN-Habitat in partnership with UNISDR and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to facilitate the assessment of the safety of critical infrastructures, focusing on schools and hospitals in South Asia.

Speaking during the inaugural session, Moria Reddick , Coordinator at Nepal Risk Reduction Consortium  (NRRC) hailed the importance of for the assessment of the schools and hospital buildings.

“We still need to work together to find a way in truly institutionalizing hospital and school safety. This means ensuring that all schools and hospitals, public or private; new or old, are disaster safe. However, the gap remains quite large. This is where I hope and see the assessment toolkit playing an important role,” Reddick said.

She added, “toolkit can support efforts for raising awareness and assessing for safety and push forward the agenda of resilience in schools and hospitals.”

“The issue of school and hospital safety is a flagship priority for the NRRC and I believe that this toolkit will go a long way in supporting Flagship 1 partners in our collective effort in promoting disaster resilient schools and hospitals and I am thankful to the government, UN-Habitat and all those involved in the development of this toolkit,” she added.

Also speaking in the program, Dr. Lava Deo Awasthi, Director General of Department of Education said that the toolkit should be user friendly and it should increase the interest of everyone to assess the degree and intensity of risk.

“The work of UN-Habitat for the development of this kind of toolkit is really praiseworthy as it has come up with a very nice message that urges to find out the risk and suggest us to diagnose the risk,” Awasthi said.

Dr. Awasthi futher said that “Ministry of Education expresses its full commitment for this novel work as for it is very much important for our future at large and particularly focusing for the patient’s and student’s welfare”.

“This kind of toolkit needs a collective intervention and advocacy as well as the local intervention and it should be taken to various places, many schools and hospitals for risk reduction,” he added.

Chairperson of the event and Deputy Director General from Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC) Sunil Kumar Karna said that Nepal remains at high risk of natural disasters as the toolkit will prove to be a milestone in assessing the disaster risk of schools and hospital buildings. “DUBDC expresses full commitment on this regard,” he added.

Habitat Program Manager, Mr. Padma Sundar Joshi made a presentation on Retro-maintenance Assessment Toolkits for School and Hospital Safety. Similarly, a presentation was made on status of Hospital buildings based on Retro-maintenance Assessment by Mr. Sagar K. Joshi, Senior Division Engineer, DUDBC.  From Department of Education Jhapper Sing Vishokarma, Senior Divisional Engineer gave presentation of school safety program and toolkit from DoE. Likewise, presentation on status of schools building based on Retro-maintenance Assessment by Dr. Santosh Shrestha from UN-Habitat.

As we know Nepal is prone to multiple disasters as every year the country succumbs to flood, fire, landslides and cold fronts along with the high risk of earthquake. In this context one of the major challenges is to protect social infrastructures like schools and hospitals for the sake of that this Toolkit has been developed. Initially the toolkit was tested in two public schools of Lalitpur and also in Bhaktapur Hospital. Likewise these toolkits have been tested in Pakistan and India. Incorporating feedbacks from field testing and test data, the Toolkits books (with CDROM) have been published and launched on 15<sup>th</sup> Earthquake Day by Secretary of Minstry Of Urban Development Mr Kishor Thapa.

After the launch of the toolkit, it has been tested in 42 school buildings of 12 public schools of Kritipur and three hospitals of Kathmandu. Most of the buildings at Kritipur were constructed more than 20 years ago and are built by traditional artisans without any input from an engineer. Both the assessment showed that buildings are vulnerable to either earthquake or fire or both. The study shows that there is an urgent need to retrofit of most buildings for protection. In addition there is also a need regular repair and maintenance.

547,8/23/2013 15:09,"Nepal is a multi-cultural multi lingual and multi-religious country with a considerable ethnic diversity, consisting of more than 100 ethnic groups. It is a stark reality that most of the ethnic communities’ are struggling to retain their culture and traditions in the face of rapid economic growth and modernizationBardiya district lies administratively in Bheri zone within mid western development region and ecologically in Tarai region (southern plains of the country). Historically, Bardiya was sparsely populated with indigenous tribal people called “Tharu”. Later, hill people (consisting of other ethnic groups) migrated into Bardiya. However, Tharu still make up a majority (more than 50%) of Bardiya’s population. Other tribals called “Sonaha” live near the Karnali River and western periphery of Bardiya National Park, who are historically engaged in extracting gold ores from sediments of river and fishing. Other ethnic communities like Magars, Muslims and Rajis (enlisted as vulnerable ethnic communities) are also living in Bardiya. Their cultural practices are shadowed amid the cultural values of well off communities. They are gradually adopting the cultures of higher castes and slowly changing their cultures to match up with other-so called higher castes. This is indeed a process of Sanskritization as introduced by M.N. Srinivasan, a renowned Indian Anthropologist.

Cultural values and beliefs are in a continuous process of taking back seats in this globalized world. Songs, the style of dancing and the attires have largely been influenced by globalization process. The dresses that were usually worn and the dances widely performed few years back are limited and can now only be seen in television or in documentary these days. This in fact is the fate of each and every community, be it a mainstream or marginalized. Not to say, much effect has been observed in the marginalized ethnic communities.

There are 31 VDCs (smallest administrative unit of the state) and 1 municipality in Bardiya district. Out of which 6 VDCs have been declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) Zone. Global Sanitation Fund Program (GSF) being executed in Nepal by UN-Habitat and funded by Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council was started in Bardiya from July 2011. Now, it is spread in all VDCs and municipality of the district in coordination with local government bodies. There is a visible sanitation movement in the district especially after introduction of the GSF program. Every VDC is moving ahead to achieve ODF situation making optimal use of local resources with creativity. Almost every day, one can observe ward or community level sanitation promotional campaigns followed by ODF declaration ceremonies with great zeal and enthusiasm. Communities are spontaneously coming out to demonstrate their dance and sing their songs. They come wearing the traditional dresses that were abandoned considering to be obsolete, sing the song which their children have almost forgotten, perform the traditional dances which are on the verge of extinction. The ODF declaration ceremonies have really become the locally acclaimed festivals these days. The natural talents that were subsided have again resurfaced and come in to the forefront mingling with the spirit generated by the ODF movement. Total Sanitation Campaign has given them opportunity and the platform where they once again are showing their talents, preserving their unique cultural identity in process. It seems that there is a positive competition to establish dignity, identity and pride through sanitation campaigns. Each and every community is willing to come forward and be on forefront to show the pride inherent in their cultural heritage. This has ultimately helped in preserving and fostering the indigenous cultures.

VDCs have also started to allocate some funds for supporting in preservation of indigenous ethnic traditions and cultural heritage by helping them to either repairing existing or buying new ones such as instruments, dresses and so on but in a cost sharing basis.In addition, the indigenous communities are rewarded in recognition to their initiation and support of ODF declaration campaign and endeavor for continuation and sustainability. This type of rewards and recognition is empowering indigenous peoples to raise their voice amidst the threatening din of ―modernization‖ and providing an amiable environment to preserve and protect their traditions.",Total Sanitation Campaign Moving Ahead by Preserving Indigenous Culture in Bardiya,publish,total-sanitation-campaign-moving-ahead-by-preserving-indigenous-culture-in-bardiya,9/18/2015 16:19

<div align=""justify"">The campaign conducted various activities including door to door visit,  community orientation, and community consultation in school catchment  area covering 278 household that enhanced community awareness on  sanitation to the large. It helped the campaigners to convince many of  community people, who expressed their interest to have toilet of their  own and requested for necessary support.</div>
<div align=""justify"">At the meantime, UN Habitat, Nepal Node for Sustainable Sanitation  (NNSS) and DWSS came forward to support villagers to construct EcoSan  toilets. Altogether 50 units of wet EcoSan toilets were constructed in  the village with this support. The extension of these facilities  benefited more than 250 inhabitants, who didn't have toilet facility  earlier.</div>
<div align=""justify"">Similarly, two units of urine collection system were installed in the  village, one at Chuna Devi Lower Secondary School and another at Centre  for Human Resource Development Unit (CHRDU), DWSS for demonstration of  urine application. The school collects 4-5 thousand litre urine every  month, while around 800 litre urine is collected from the system at  CHRDU.</div>
<div align=""justify"">The villagers, who had only heard about urine application, started  harvesting urine and applying in agriculture to supplement nitrogenous  requirement of their cultivation after these constructions. The faeces  will also be utilized as a soil conditioner.  These practices helped  community people decrease their dependency on chemical fertilizer;  taught them the way to utilize human excreta; and helped them to grow  organic food. Moreover, it brought behavioral change among villagers;  decreased open defecation remarkably and improved health condition by  improving environmental sanitation in the communities.</div>
<div align=""justify"">It soon impressed other community people, who also started demanding for  support to construct toilet at their homes. Responding their demand,  DWSS provided necessary support to the villagers. Additional five units  of EcoSan toilet were constructed with this support, while remaining 20  units are under construction.</div>
<div align=""justify"">The success that the campaign gained and the improvement it brought in  sanitation situation in these communities motivated Nanu Maiya and other  campaigners to increase their dedication in the campaign. They are now  making a broad vision to declare Nagarkot VDC as a whole ODF. Therefore,  they have recently expanded their catchment area to Pipalbot and  Lamatole. They are constructing 40 units of EcoSan toilets in these new  communities in their first phase and planning to expand activities  gradually.</div>",UN Habitat supporting EcoSan Toilet Promotional Campaign in Nagarkot,publish,ecosan-unhabitat,4/9/2014 12:24
558,7/12/2011 18:00,"The “Arsenic Mitigation Programme"" promoted different arsenic mitigation options as the alternatives to arsenic contaminated water in nine arsenic affected Terai Districts of Nepal. Benefitting over 44,706 people it has also decreased the vulnerability of people exposed to arsenic poisoning in these areas. The programme was carried out by Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS), UNICEF and UN-HABITAT, while the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) facilitated for implementing it at local level.

In Nepal, the first case of arsenic contamination was reported in 1999 by DWSS during the arsenic testing conducted with support of WHO in the groundwater of of Terai. Later, UN-HABITAT and with UNICEF supported DWSS in carrying out blanket arsenic testing in groundwater sources of 7 other arsenic affected districts including Jhapa, Morang, Mahottari, Banke, Bardiya, Dang and Chitwan.
<div>

The arsenic testing reported over 1 million people living in 20 Terai Districts of Nepal to be vulnerable to arsenic poisoning. They were compelled to drinking water with an arsenic concentration higher than the WHO guideline of 10 ppb. It also estimated that nearly 300,000 people were consuming water with concentration higher than the guideline value provided by Government of Nepal i.e 50ppb.

In response to the result of these testing's, the arsenic mitigation programme was launched in Bardiya, Banke, Parsa, Bara, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Saptari, Siraha, Sunsari- the nine highly arsenic affected districts in terai of Nepal to increase accessibility of local people to arsenic free safe drinking water.

The programme has oriented thousands of people on arsenic contamination. They have also been sensitized on the arsenic poisoning and its mitigation options. It has conducted focus group discussions at community level, made household visits and organized street drama shows to further augment their knowledge on these issues, which aided to create demand for arsenic mitigation options in these districts.

Addressing the developing demand, the programme has distributed around 6000 units of Kanchan Arsenic Filter (KAF) to help people treat arsenic contaminated water at household level. Additionally, it has installed 175 new tube wells at the places with arsenic free aquifer and improved more than 30 existing dug wells in these districts. The programme has also established a demonstration site of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) System to introduce rainwater as an arsenic free natural source of water and encourage people for adopting this technology.

In addition to equipping the local people with safe options to arsenic poisoning, it has trained them on arsenic blanket testing and safe drinking water options. It has generated human resources at local level and empowered local authorities to cope existing arsenic problem independently. Resource persons like teachers, entrepreneurs, health workers, community motivators, local leaders, technicians, and journalist have also been trained and oriented for continuous dissemination of the arsenic issues in their locality.

As a result of the project activities, people now have access to safe drinking water.

Mr. Padma Sundar Joshi, Habitat Manager, UN Habitat Nepal, highlighted on the traditional water management system in Kathmandu Valley and linkage on the Machhendranath festival celebration in the programme. He further explained the Kathmandu city as a superb example of an eco-city based on the water management system with the provision of water canal  (rajkulo), ponds and stone spouts. The cities of this valley developed a brilliant example of sustainable water management and linked it with socio-cultural practices.</span></p>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5em;"">Mr. Joshi highlighted the city planning and city water supply system of Kathmandu valley that started at least 1500 years ago in Kirat, Lichchhavi and Malla dynasties. The city is planned as a design of Mandala with the three concentric circles; Human settlement domain, agricultural domain and natural domain. Kirats developed the gravity flow water system from the springs and Licchhavis introduced the dug well technology to utilize the ground water in Kathmandu valley.</span>

Mr. Joshi introduced the Hiti system of the stone spouts of the Kathmandu valley. The natural spring water from Budhanilkantha, Bageshwori and Tika Bhairav brought through water canal (rajkulo) and storage in the public ponds in city since last 1500 years. The ponds contributed as aquifers of the water supply system. Water collected in the ponds infiltrated in the ground and flowed to stone spouts through cannels for public supply. The stone spouts are managed in the human settlement, on the way to farm and the natural sanctuaries to serve water to the public for different purpose.

He described the Hiti system; stone spout (Hiti) platform, intake, watercanal, filtration system and reservoir. He stressed on the importance of all the system for sustainable water supply. He explained the social engagement and linkages in the traditional water management system, family level, neighbourhood level and state level. He further explained the linkages of Machchhendranath festival in city water system. Machchhendranath festival is linked with the sustainable water system, certain rituals are linked with particular water body; ponds and stone spouts. The community level trust fund mechanism Guthi also established to execute and sustain the activities of traditional water supply management. There are many cultural festivals celebrated in the water sources to encourage water source protection and conservation.

He expressed his worries on destruction and interruption of the traditional water management system with the modern development activities. Encroachment of the ponds and stone spout platforms, interruption of water cannels and construction of private dug wells destroyed the traditional water system of the Kathmandu valley. The deep basement buildings and laying of hume pipes for city storm water also affected on the traditional system of water flow in ponds, dug wells and stone spouts.

Mr. Bhushan Tuladhar, Regional Technical Advisor, UN Habitat Water for Asian Cities, expressed that the traditional water management system of Kathmandu valley was an excellent and complete system of water management.

July 2011, Lalitpur: We have now our own supply of water. The recharge project has greatly helped us in replenishing the dug well explainedAsha Kaji Shrestha, a member of <em>Nyhakha Chuka Tole Sudhar Samiti</em> at ward no. 16 in Lalitpur.

The two recharge wells and two storm water collection chambers constructed in the court yard has helped to maintain the water table of the traditional wells. Now the community is managing the water supply for 250 households within the <em>Nyakha Chuka</em> and its surroundings. The user committee members have been active in the supply and management of the system.

Gone are the days when we have to quarrel with the city water supply office for inadequate water supply. Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL) has never been able to fix its water distribution in the community. Recharging our own land during rainfall gave us sufficient water to extract. It did not only serve us in this crisis but also fulfilled the demand of our neighboring community. We have now eight hours water supply in a day shares Mr. Shrestha with delight to the delegates of Coca-Cola and UN Habitat that visited on 4<sup>th</sup> July.

Under the project “Rainwater Harvesting and Groundwater Recharge in Patan”, Center for Integrated Urban Development (CIUD) constructed 16 recharge wells and 21 rainwater collection chambers to replenish the underground aquifer to support 20 different committees in Lalitpur in coordination with Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City (LSMC) and Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Board (KVWSMB).

<p align=""justify"">However, with the initiation of rainwater recharge programme in the area in 2009, locals from around 250 households around Nyhakha Chuke Tole and adjoining areas in Lalitpur get their own water supply with successful replenishment of their underground aquifer through rainwater harvesting. Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City (LSMC), Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Board (KVWSMB) with support from Center for Integrated Urban Development (CIUD), UN Habitat and The Bottlers Nepal Limited launched the rainwater harvesting programme to replenish the underground aquifer to support 20 different committees in Lalitpur in 2009. “The dug wells are being successfully replenished due to rainwater recharge system. Now, most households in our area have already shut off the KUKL drinking water pipe lines,” said Shakya.</p>
<p align=""justify"">According to Rojin Karmacharya, coordinator at CIUD, there is a total of 16 recharge wells and 21 rainwater collection chambers to recharge the community aquifer during the rainy season to supplement groundwater. “Most people in Lalitpur rely on shallow groundwater and it is depleting at an alarming rate due to over extraction and reduced recharge,” he said. Karmacharya added that now the communities actively involved in successfully managing rainwater harvesting in the area have started constructing overhead tanks to collect the water and later distribute to households in their areas. The rainwater promotion programme aims to establish RWH system in traditional ponds, community level recharge wells and pits to make people aware of the recharge mechanism and augment groundwater level.</p>

125,7/24/2011 4:46,"JUL 23 2011 - At a time when the urbanization process has accelerated at an exponential rate threatening the quality of city life, the government in support with the concerned stakeholders is conducting a study on vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning in Kathmandu this year.

Nepal has been identified as one of the most vulnerable countries to impacts of climate change and is a country with one of the highest rates of urbanisation, the linkage between cities and climate change is a critical issue, according to experts.

The government record shows that urbanisation is growing at the rate of 6.44 percent every year. It has been estimated that the country’s urban population will reach 25 percent by 2015 and 50 percent by 2025, according to Suresh Prasad Acharya, joint secretary at the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works.

Nepal being one of the countries with the highest urbanisation rate, it is high time that we discussed on adaptation and mitigation methodology including urban planning and legislation to impacts of climate change, said Bhusan Tuladhar, technical chief at UN-HABITAT Nepal, office.

Kathmandu Valley is facing a series of problems like waste management, sanitation and growing slum areas due to the lack of urban planning strategies and legal framework.

The new study being undertaken under UN-HABITAT’s Cities and Climate Change Initiative will help understand and address the linkages between climate change and urban development in Kathmandu, particularly relating to water management, Tuladhar said.

Though the government has adopted a National Urban Policy for the balanced national structure, healthy and economically vibrant urban environment and effective urban management since 2008, it is not effectively implemented as the urban environment is found significantly deteriorating.

<p align=""justify"">Kathmandu: The country continues to celebrate national water week every year to mark World Water Day on March 22, and the issue of water management should have steered a course but there is scant progress on this front. Experts attribute this to failure to prioritise four important areas: Developing awareness on freshwater, advocacy on water, investigation and study on water, and capacity building.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“There is the need for a consortium to advocate water issues and lobbying at the policy making level, which hasn’t happened till date,” said Adarsha Pokharel, vice chairman of the national water week organising committee. The theme of World Water Day this year—”Water for Cities”—highlights some of the main challenges of water management in urban areas, especially the increasingly difficult task in Kathmandu Valley where shortage of water is a perennial problem and the likelihood of the situation worsening in coming days is high.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Ravi Sharma Aryal, spokesman for the organising committee and Joint Secretary of Water and Energy Secretariat, said the government hasn’t prioritised the management of freshwater sources in the country. Among the various factors leading to water crisis in the Capital, rapid urbanisation and increase in population growth are the main causes, he said.
Groundwater source that accounts for around 50 percent of total drinking water supply is being over extracted resulting in depletion of already diminishing water resources. More than 30 percent of the people in Kathmandu Valley depend on groundwater, according to a conservative estimate. It seems the days ahead will go from bad to worse.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Experts are warning that more than 80 percent of groundwater used for drinking purposes in Kathmandu contains high level of bacteria and other harmful microbes. The depletion of groundwater level is alarming. Earlier, digging down till 20 feet was enough to strike groundwater. Now, it is hard to strike water even at a depth of 40 feet, say experts.
Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL), the sole utility responsible for the distribution of potable water in Kathmandu Valley, alone pumps out around 60 million litres of groundwater a day.</p>
<p align=""justify"">According to KUKL spokesperson Suresh Prasad Acharya, the water body every year digs four tube wells in different places in Kathmandu Valley. The daily water demand at present is 320 million litres but the supply is only around 130 million litres, he said. KUKL runs 70 tubewells, of which 60 are operating, while it is planning to construct 35 additional wells within four years. Ground Water Resource Management Board (GWMB) estimates groundwater extraction to be two million litres daily. At this rate, 23 million cubic litres of groundwater is pumped out in Kathmandu Valley annually, which is more than twice than the recharge.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The groundwater level is said to be sinking at an average rate of over four meters annually at present, far ahead than an average rate of 2.5 meters per year in 1990 as stated in a study carried out by JICA.</p>
<p align=""justify"">If groundwater extraction continues at this rate a disaster of the worst kind is likely, said engineer Ishwor Raj Onta. “We are aware of the threat but cannot do anything without a policy in place. The haphazard pumping out of water should be checked on time.” He said the government needs to allocate space to dig ponds for recharging groundwater as fertile land is fast turning into a concrete jungle.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Policy awaits govt nod</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Kathmandu: To curb rampant groundwater extraction in Kathmandu Valley, Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Board had prepared a final draft of the groundwater management policy months ago. The draft, however, is awaiting the green signal from the Cabinet.

According to BC, tube wells constructed for domestic purpose must be registered with the board and license needs to be obtained to extract water for commercial purposes below and above 100 meters. “We will decide on granting permission to extract groundwater by studying particular areas,” said BC. “The policy especially focuses on making groundwater extraction balanced by identifying groundwater as an important source of water.”</p>

Stressing that water for sanitation is a serious issue, he said, “There is urgent need for a national dialogue on urban water management.” According to Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS), groundwater is the source of 50 percent of the drinking water in Kathmandu and increasing dependence on it is resulting in its depletion.
Ravi Sharma Aryal, Joint Secretary at the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat, said the large-scale groundwater extraction for commercial purposes is mainly to blame. Aryal said the time has come to prepare a proper policy on groundwater uses, regulate its competitive extraction, deal with ownership issues, reduce overlapping authority, adopt a license system for commercial purposes and enact a special law.
A census projection estimates the population of Kathmandu Valley in 2011 is 2.2 million and the number is likely to swell after the 2011 census. The urbanisation rate of Nepal is 6.44 percent, with Kathmandu Valley alone covering 31 percent of that chunk.</p>

<p align=""justify"">Kathmandu: To meet the national target of universal access to basic sanitation facilities (access to toilets) by 2017, the government has approved the ambitious Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan (2010-2017) after more than three years of its recognition in the country’s national plan in 2008. Approved this week, it will be vital in enabling the environment for institutional and financial mechanisms to meet the Millennium Development Goal and national targets in sanitation.</p>
<p align=""justify"">To meet the sanitation MDG, Nepal has to achieve at least 53 percent toilet coverage by 2015. The present coverage stands at around 43 percent. The master plan is formulated by the National Steering Committee for National Sanitation Action to expedite sanitation promotion and demonstrate Nepal’s commitment to its sanitation endeavors. Nepal needs an annual investment of Rs. 7.5 billion to enable universal access to basic water and sanitation facilities by 2017, according to government data. Despite gradual achievements in sanitation 57 percent of the country’s population lacks access to toilets, said Nanda Bahadur Khanal, senior divisional engineer at the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW). Khanal said the master plan envisages four sequential steps for promoting hygiene and sanitation—institution building, planning and programming; Open Defecation Free (ODF) campaigning, behaviour change and post ODF campaigning (total sanitation). The trend of toilet coverage indicates Nepal will attain the MDG but it needs pragmatic vision, operational strategies, strengthened institutional arrangements, adequate resources and stakeholders’ collaborative efforts to achieve national goal of universal toilet coverage by 2017.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Implementation of the plan is timely and important at this point of time, according to experts, who state that the launch of Global Sanitation Fund in 2010 and which is to be managed by UN-HABITAT for the next five years will play an instrumental role in speeding up programmes and activities envisioned by the Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan. A total of US $ 5 million is committed under GSF to help the country implement the plan, increase sanitation coverage and strengthen concerned stakeholders including civil society, local administration and the private sector, among others.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Bhushan Tuladhar, UN-HABITAT chief technical advisor, said the declaration of ODF areas and adoption of total sanitation approach across the country particularly in rural parts is the plan's important aspect. Under the plan, village development committee and municipalities have been identified as basic units of sanitation planning and emphasis has been given at the local level for strategic plans on sanitation. “The endorsement of the master plan is timely and appropriate at a time when the country is working to meet the sanitation MDG target and national target of universal access to sanitation by year 2017,” Tuladhar said.</p>

170,7/29/2011 11:59,"Karachi, The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Pakistan, has launched ‘Water and Environmental Sanitation Improvement Project in Coastal Communities of Karachi’.

The launching ceremony was organized by WWF with support from United Nations Human Settlements Program (UN-HABITAT) and the Coca-Cola Company. The two year project is being implemented in Kakapir and Soomer villages, catering to 300 households who rely heavily on fishing income. The area is deficient on water supply, sewerage system and solid waste management, which the project will address through public awareness, capacity building and institutional setup. The ceremony was attended by government representatives, subject specialists, civil society, private sector, academia, community members and media. Welcoming the participants, Dr. Ejaz Ahmed, Deputy Director General, WWF Pakistan, highlighted the unique nature of the project, in terms of diverse partnership including public and private sector, as well as local NGOs and UN-HABITAT. He mentioned the collective commitment of the partners in reducing water footprint and improving environmental sanitation. Mr. Syed Hasan Eijaz Kazmi, Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), an autonomous body, deliberated on their institutional efforts to redress the problem of water and sanitation in urban areas, which generate 470 million gallons of sewage.

<!--more-->Their initiatives include multistage pumping from the two water sources (Hub Dam 100mgd and River Indus 550mgd), Citizens Report Card and Performance Benchmarking. One of the project sponsors, UN-HABITAT, was represented by Mr. Siamak Moghaddam, Country Programme Manager, who briefed the audience on the agency’s programme in Pakistan, and the corresponding field interventions. He stressed on the need for addressing human settlements and rapid urbanization issues, especially in Karachi, a city he identified as the engine driving Pakistan. Another UN-HABITAT representative, Mr. Bhushan Tuladhar, Regional Technical Advisor for Water for Asian Cities Programme, illustrated the project significance in terms of its role in partnership and perseverance to bridge the gap between humans and nature. The other project sponsor, The Coca-Cola Company representative, Mr. Fahad Qadir, Regional Public Affairs and Communication Manager, shared their global commitment for improving the quality of life in less privileged communities, such as the selected villages near Sandspit and Hawksbay Beach. Mr. Hashim, President of Fishermen Development Organization Kakapir Village informed the audience on the impact of ongoing partnership initiatives in nature conservation and community development. Mr. Aijaz Nizamani, Secretary, Forest and Wildlife Sindh stressed on the need for government bodies to learn efficient management systems from the private and NGO sector. Subhash K Dawani, Manager Conservation (Sindh) WWF Pakistan, presented the prevalent issues, sanitation practices and project roadmap. This was followed by closing remarks by Rab Nawaz, Director, WWF, who appreciated the work of project partners and expressed hope in addressing water security concerns of Pakistan through concerted efforts.

173,8/25/2011 6:51,"The approval of the much-awaited Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan (2011-2017) by the government earlier this month is an encouraging move towards materializing the national target of universal access to toilet by 2017.

It is believed that the formulation of the Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan will help to expedite the pace of sanitation promotion and demonstrate the country’s commitment in its sanitation endeavors. During all the earlier South Asian Conferences on Sanitation organized time and again, Nepal had showed firm commitment to develop the Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan and help the concerned stakeholders in effective planning, budgeting, human resource mobilization, implementation, monitoring and evaluation and follow up of the ongoing hygiene and sanitation programmes and projects in the country.

According to experts, though there is a gradual achievements and improvement in the sanitation and hygiene sector in past two decades, however, still around 57 percent population across country lacks access to a toilet. This means, despite the simulation of Open Defecation Free (ODF) areas, public awareness and capacity development activities of concerned stakeholders, partners and local communities, increase in funding by the government and partners, there is still a big challenge in achieving the perceived health benefits from water supply and sanitation facilities. During 1990s, only six percent population across the country had sanitation coverage (access to toilet) while the government’s data in 2009 states a total of 43 percent population across the country has access to a toilet till date. The annual growth rate of sanitation increment thus stands at 1.9 percent.Meanwhile, the toilet coverage in urban areas is 78 percent against the rural coverage of only 37 percent. It proves that that there is a big disparity between urban and rural sanitation, although urban areas have other urban specific problems of solid and liquid waste. Interestingly, urban toilet coverage has stagnated at around 80 percent since 2000 and the trend analysis shows that if the present trend is continued, the toilet coverage will be only 80 percent against the national target of universal coverage in 2017. Meanwhile the statistics of Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) in 2009 stated out of the total five development regions of the country, the far and mid western regions have the least sanitation coverage with only about 30 percent whereas, western development region has the highest
sanitation coverage with about 53 percent of the respective total regional population.As the above mentioned figure suggests, there is still a need of pragmatic vision, strengthened institutional arrangements and adequate resources and collaboration among the stakeholders to meet both MDG and national sanitation targets.

Meanwhile, for the effective implementation of the Master Plan including speeding up programmes and activities envisioned by the plan, the launch of Global Sanitation Fund in October 2010 is considered to play a vital role in the country.

More importantly, both, Master Plan and GSF envision the important role of local government bodies to provide water and sanitation facilities throughout the country. In the recent years, the local government bodies namely District Development Committees (DDCs), Village Development Committees (VDCs) and municipalities have recognised the initiation of promotional actions on sanitation to achieve Open Defecation Free initiative through their annual planning. As mentioned in both Master Plan and GSF, each local body’s role in sanitation promotion, particularly in achieving ODF status in various communities should be integrated appropriately and a participatory approach should be taken in achieving success in overall status of sanitation and hygiene.

According to Dinesh Raj Manandhar, project manager of the GSF, the programme is moving in a progressive way. The process of selecting sub-grantees for the implementation of the programme in five different districts namely Bajura, Bardiya, Argakanchi, Sindhupalchowk and Sunsari and five municipalities namely Tikapur, Gulariya, Dharan, Itahari and Inaruwa is undergoing and soon the name of the recipients will be announced. The programme targets a total population around 1,750,000. The major four components of the GSF are simulating Open Defecation Area (ODF), capacity development of stakeholders, implementation of Sanitation Master Plan and knowledge management, he added.

Manandhar said as stated in the master plan, the role of local government bodies is well-defined and considered to mainstream to accelerate hygiene and sanitation development, which is also included as a major component in GSF. “Local bodies are part and parcel of sanitation framework and there is a need to define their role and empower them to strengthen different sanitation related campaigns and works. Most importantly, it is the local fund that will be important and sustainable in any community,” he added.

The GSF programme aims to achieve total sanitation coverage in its five target districts using Community Led Total Sanitation, School Led Total Sanitation and sanitation marketing approaches. “As a part of the GSF programme, we will provide software resources like trainings and knowledge management workshops, resource pooling arrangement and sharing to benefit the communities with needed knowledge and awareness in basic sanitation and hygiene practices including construction of toilets.

“Though there is favorable environment in promoting sanitation and hygiene facilities in the country, there is still a challenge of coordination among the stakeholders at different levels to work in this sector,” said Manandhar. At the same time, the political instability and lack of leadership due to failure of the government to nominate officials in local administration also are considered major challenges to meet the MDG and national target of sanitation in the country.

Our efforts in addressing these issues until today look very different from what is necessary. The problems we face today are multidimensional--- environmental, geological, health and other hazards to worry for. Whether or not the water pipelines to our homes are running seems immaterial if we consider the further consequences that our unplanned behaviour poses before us. Waiting without substantial efforts might turn out to be a headlong charge into disaster. If we fail to wake up today,tomorrow may never provide us a chance.

Minister for Physical Planning and Works Hridesh Tripathy inaugurated the workshop and make public Urban Environment Management Guideline 2066 and the Urban Development bulletin World Habitat Day especial edition in the program.

Minister Tripathy stressed on the need to manage urbanization to mitigate the effects of climate change. Speaking at a program, Minister Tripathy said, “Urban population is growing due to availability of facilities and opportunities in the urban, but it lacks proper management.” He added, “Climate change is affecting water resources, therefore, along with increasing urbanization, people should also focus on mitigating the effects of climate change.” He said all Nepalese had to maintain economic discipline and integrity to contribute to the country’s development.

Tulasi Prasad Sitaula, MoPPW secretary, said 20 per cent Nepalese live in urban areas and the trend of migrating in the urban area is increasing. “Along with management of basic infrastructure and facilities, we should also pay attention to mitigating the effects of climate change,” Sitaula said.

Kishor Thapa, secretary, Election Commission, said, “Along with data and figures publicized by foreign experts and organizations, we should also conduct research to mitigate effects of climate change"". ""The impact of climate change is directly linked with the water resources, so we could mitigate the adverse impact of climate change with the proper water resources management"" he advised.

Mahendra Subba, Director-General, DUDBC, said Nepal was witnessing the effects of climate change, adding, “The government had launched various programs to minimize the impacts caused by rapid urbanization in Nepal.”

Bhusan Tuladhar, South Asia Regional Technical Adviser at UN-Habitat, said, ""Kathmandu Valley’s temperature is increasing faster than global and national average. Kathmandu is vulnerable to climate change, mainly because of rapid urbanization, poor urban planning and management."" He added “Activities in urban areas are contributing to the emission of greenhouse gases and increasing the effects of climate change, therefore we need to launch environment preservation programs.” He presented the Preliminary Findings of Vulnerability Assessment &amp; Adaptation Planning in Kathmandu Valley in the program. He shared adaptation measures on thematic area of Water and Sanitation, Settlements &amp; Infrastructure, Climate-induced Disasters, Public Health, Agriculture &amp; Forests. He suggested ""The adaptation measures need to focus on integrated water resource management and pro-poor urban planning and management and capacity of local governments need to be enhanced on climate change.""

Chief Executive Officers, Chiefs of Environment Department and other officials of the five municipalities of Kathmandu valley had participated in the workshop.

Mr. Padma Sunder Joshi, Habitat Programme Manager highlighted the importance of knowledge on impacts of the climate change in the cities. He urged urban planners and the local government officials should understand the two parallel phenomena, urbanization and climate change particularly in the context of cities. He further shared the UN-HABITAT initiatives ‗cities and climate change initiative‘ to understand and address the linkage between climate change and urban development in major cities of the globe. He urged the study on 'Vulnerable Assessment and Adaptation Planning in Kathmandu' as ""cities and climate change initiatives"" programme of UN Habitat, will assist to identify the issues and context of the hilly cities.<!--more-->

Ms. Lowie Rosales, Regional Representative, UN HABITAT Regional Office, said urbanization and climate change are two major human created elements that have negative and dangerous impacts upon quality of life and economic condition of the people and their social stability. She further added that climate change effects such as extreme weather events, damage to urban infrastructure, problems of waterborne disease, food security, and climate refugees are higher in rapidly urbanizing cities.

Ms. Lowie Rosales explained on the 'cities and climate change initiatives' programme of UN Habitat to respond climate change issues to contributes to reduce green house gas emission and city level vulnerability. She suggested to minimize the gap between national and local government level climate change adaptations as well as mitigation policy and actions. She urged to enhance and scale up the skill as and capacity of local government authorities on climate change and urban infrastructure development.

Mr. Binod Prakash Shinh, Under Secretary at Ministry of Local Development, told that the Nepal Government has initiated the national level programmes to address the challenges of impacts of climate change and urbanization. He stressed on implementation of the local government led action oriented programmes to mitigate the climate change impacts and urbanization. He added the government should initiate to strengthen the local authority institutions through the policy as well as the programmes to mitigate the climate change impact and challenges in the cities.
Mr. Bhushan Tuladhar, Chief Technical Advisor at UN Habitat Water for Asian Cities, South Asia Region, briefed on the phenomenon and evolution effort on climate change. He informed that the cities occupied 2 percent of the area in the globe and responsible for up to 70 percent of greenhouse gas emission (GHGs). It should be focused to understand the linkages between climate change and urban development; and accelerate the activities which minimize the climate change impacts.

He further told that more than 95 percent of the global population growth will be in urban area and 92 percent of these growths will be added in the developing countries. He further shared that Nepal's urbanization rate is 6.4 percent which is the highest in Asia region and Kathmandu valley occupied 31 percent of total urban population of the country. Mentioning that Nepal has been identified as on of the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change with one of the highest rates of urbanization, he has stressed on risk of unprecedented negative impacts of climate change on the quality of life and economic and social stability due to the rapidly urbanizing in Kathmandu.

He shared the Preliminary Findings of study on Vulnerability Assessment &amp; Adaptation Planning in Kathmandu Valley jointly conducted by the government of Nepal and UN-HABITAT. He highlighted the findings of vulnerability assessment and adaptation plans for understanding and addressing the linkages between climate change and urban development in Kathmandu, especially the water and sanitation management and Settlements &amp; infrastructure aspect in the Kathmandu valley.

563,10/21/2011 14:24,"Updated baseline information of the working districts under the Global Sanitation Fund (GSF) Programme is very much essential for effective planning, implementation and monitoring and evaluation. Although the water and sanitation sector has established a database on the water and sanitation which is generally referred to as National Management Information Project (NMIP) and in addition MPPW has MIS system in place, a regular updating of the database has always been a challenge. Referring to this, the baseline survey which is being conducted in the five working districts and five municipalities of GSF Programme Nepal is to support the NMIP database and getting an updated data on the water and sanitation.

UN-Habitat Nepal has started to collect the baseline data for the implementation of Global Sanitation Fund (GSF) programme in Nepal under the aegis of Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC) Geneva. Under the first phase, Bajura and Bardiya district including Gulariya from Bardiya district and Tikapur Municipality from adjoining district Kailali are taken for the collection, updating and verification of baseline data on sanitation and hygiene of schools, institutions and communities. Development Resource Centre (DRC) as a service provider has shouldered the responsibility of carrying out the job in close coordination with UN-Habitat Nepal‘s GSF Programme and respective District/Municipality-Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene- Coordination Committees (D/M-WASH-CCs).

A two day's orientation training cum workshop to the enumerators has already been completed in Gulariya and Martadi-the district headquarters of Bardiya and Bajura district respectively as a kick off workshop to start the baseline survey. Altogether 32 enumerators including 23 women representing indigenous and Dalit (oppressed caste) actively took part in the orientation workshop. In both the workshops held at different dates (23-24 October in Bardiya and 18-19 November in Bajura) Chiefs from District Administrative Office, District Public Heath Office, District Education Office, Women Development Office, Water Supply and Sanitation Division Office and Office of the District Development Committee delivered some words of wisdom for information and motivation to the participants. They also made commitments for possible support from their part for the successful completion of the baseline survey as well as implementation of GSF program activities. Local Development Officer and chair person of D-WASH-CC from respective districts chaired the inauguration session at both the occasions. There is no denying the fact that this orientation event will be a mile stone for successful implementation of GSF program and making the district Open Defecation Free, opined all. The stakeholders from the district including line agency chiefs have been optimistic about the fact that this will provide in insight in to formulating a pragmatic district, VDC and Municipality WASH strategic plan/plan of action in line with Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan 2011 and strenghening coordination, cooperation and ownership. A multifarious team from DRC with M&amp;E Specialist and Sociologist from GSF program, UN-Habitat facilitated the sessions. Sensitizing sessions regarding sanitation and hygiene were also carried out in a bid to prepare the participants (enumerators) as motivators and activists to back up sanitation movement in the district in the days ahead.

Now, with the support of Strengthening Water, Air, Sanitation and Hygiene Treasuring Health( SWASHTHA) project that is being implemented in five communities of Tikapur Municipality in partnership with the Municipality, ENPHO, MuAN and Practical Action and financed by EU and UN-Habitat‘s Water for Asian Cities Programme. His family has stopped open defecation, drinks purified water and no smokier kitchen. Chaudhari family now has ecological sanitation (ECOSAN) toilet, silver colloidal (CS) filter and has installed improved cooked stove (ICS).

30 years old Chaudhari migrated in Jamuna Tole, ward 04 of Tikapur in 1995. Main profession of eight members Chaudhari family is agriculture. Chaudhari is also a teacher in a local school. Though he is an educated person and knew the importance of toilet, he was not building it. ""Everybody in the community did not have toilet, thus I did not build too"" Chaudhari explained when he was asked why he did not build toilet earlier. ""But I have to face lots of embarrassment of not having toilet, especially when friends and guest arrived at home and ask for toilet"", He recalled his bitter experience. ""I've to go far for defecation in order to hide from people and during rainy season and night time, it was too difficult"" Raj Kumari Chaudhari, wife of Chaudhari expressed her also difficulties. He learnt about various types of toilet from orientations of SWASHTHA project. He was initially not convinced to build ECOSAN toilet. However, after participating in ECOSAN training and seeing such toilet during the exposure visit in Kathmandu, he made up his mind to build such environmentally friendly toilet. The project supported material subsidy of NRs. 3500 and he top up NRs. 8000 to build his wet ECOSAN.

With the support from the project, he has now CS filter which has dual function. Firstly, it filters turbidity and secondly it disinfects micro-organism. Chaudhari has built concrete platform that prevents water logging around the hand pump. The platform prevents direct seepage of contaminated water through pipe of hand pump. He has built a wooden rack to keep cooking utensils to dry cooking utensil after washing them. The surrounding environment is now cleaner. The family has also installed mud improved cooked stove (ICS). ""My kitchen is now clean; previously it used to be full of noxious smoke"", Chaudhari is happy to have ICS in her kitchen. All family members practice hand-washing with soap- water in critical times (before eating, after toilet and after touching waste). Decomposable waste is converted into compost along with cow dung and being used in the farm. Further, the floor of cow shed has been improved with concrete floor that eases to clean the cow dung and there is a small gutter made in the cow shed to collect urine of cattle. The family uses urine in farm as a fertiliser.

In this way, a Chaudhari family is creating a model healthy home and influencing others to create healthy community as a whole. The house of Chaudhari family is an example of integrated approach to WASH (water, air, sanitation and hygiene).",Household in far west Nepal creating a healthy home with support of European Union and UN-Habitat,publish,household-in-far-west-nepal-creating-a-healthy-home-with-support-of-european-union-and-un-habitat,8/19/2014 12:28
565,2/9/2012 15:56,"<strong>KATHMANDU, 9 February 2012 (IRIN)</strong> - In Nepal where one of the biggest childhood killers is water-borne diseases, officials are slowly adopting decentralized ways of treating urban wastewater.

There is currently one fully operational central wastewater treatment plant in Kathmandu, a city of an estimated one million.

Only 12 percent of Nepal’s urban households nationwide have access to sewer networks - with most pipelines draining directly into a river or one of several non-functioning plants - and only 5 percent of wastewater is properly treated, according to the Kathmandu office of UK-based NGO <a href=""http://www.wateraid.org/documents/plugin_documents/decentralised_wastewater_management_using_constructed_wetlands_in_nepal.pdf"" target=""_blank"">WaterAid</a>.

Decentralized wastewater treatment systems (DEWATS) in Nepal treat small volumes of wastewater close to the source using low-maintenance, often natural technologies, as opposed to energy intensive central plants, which was the only option until 15 years ago when <a href=""http://www.enpho.org/"" target=""_blank"">a local NGO</a> first installed DEWATS around Kathmandu. “The users are closer to the facility, so the chances of better management are higher,” said Bhushan Tuladhar, the South Asia regional technical adviser for UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT).

The system spreads accountability as well as risk, he added. “When there are lots of different plants, in a way you are not putting all your eggs in one basket.”

Moving wastewater from the source to treatment accounts for some 80 percent of overall treatment costs, according to <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/53/38/42349741.pdf"" target=""_blank"">experts</a>.

Traditional plants typically use technology that requires skilled technicians, often in short supply in places most in need of wastewater treatment.

Sewerage and drinking water lines are too closely constructed in Kathmandu, which leads to near instantaneous <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/watsan/Docs/Student%20Theses/Nepal/Wolfe2000.pdf"" target=""_blank"">water contamination</a> in the case of pipe leakage, which is frequent, said Madhav Pahari, UN Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) water and sanitation specialist in Nepal.

Now a proven technology, experts have successfully lobbied for DEWATS in government policies in recent years, arguing it can decrease water contamination and slash deaths by diarrhoea.

<strong>Pathogens </strong><strong>
</strong>
Water and food-borne diseases accounted for almost 13 percent of outpatient visits (65,000) nationwide in 2009-2010, according to the Department of Health.

In a recently published <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0035920311001659"" target=""_blank"">scientific survey</a>, samples taken from a major river running through Kathmandu were “heavily” contaminated with various pathogens, with some levels rivalling those in untreated water in a treatment plant.

With support from the UN, WaterAid and the Asian Development Bank, local NGO Environment and Public Health Organization constructed a community treatment plant in Sunga, 8km southeast of Kathmandu, in 2005 at a cost of US$27,000.

“The site on which the treatment plant was constructed used to be very dirty, with a dilapidated school abandoned after a landslide hit it. We would throw our garbage there,” said Krishna Lal Shrestha, chairman of the local water management committee.

Since then, wastewater from over 80 households filters through beds of coarse sand, gravel and specialized reed plants before being released into a local river.

The plant at Sunga is one of several community based sanitation systems constructed in neighbourhoods in and bordering Kathmandu Valley, which includes the cities of Bhaktapur, Patan and Kathmandu.

Implementation of DEWATS in these communities usually requires building household latrines connected to the drainage network.

After similar community treatment systems were installed in India, open defecation nearly disappeared, health expenditures for women and children decreased by an average 60 percent and school attendance increased significantly, said Pedro Kraemer, programme coordinator for South Asia at the Germany-headquartered Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association (<a href=""http://www.borda-net.org/"" target=""_blank"">BORDA</a>).

<strong>Mainstreaming </strong><strong>
</strong>
Some 30 DEWATS have been constructed mostly in and around Kathmandu over the past 15 years with both public and private funding.

But without strong local governance, it is still premature to decentralize wastewater management, said Pahari. “The [1999] <a href=""http://www.mld.gov.np/pdf_downloadable_file/local_self_governance_act_2055%281999%29_english.pdf"" target=""_blank"">local self-governance act</a> talks about decentralization of all basic services, but we don’t have any elected bodies.”

Following a decade-long civil war, declared officially over in 2006, the government has yet to adopt a new constitution. As a consequence, local elections have not taken place.

But Tuladhar from UN-HABITAT said even without locally elected officials, communities can still manage, citing irrigation, education and forestry as examples.

“The city needs to accommodate [its] logistics and infrastructure to a new scenario… and to requirements for maintenance... The problem is essentially one of power,” he said, referring to how the national government is reticent on relinquishing control of wastewater management.

One of the biggest obstacles thus far to replicating DEWATS may be lack of vision, said the government’s director of a small town water supply project in the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage, Ram Deep Sah.

There are at least four different government bodies responsible for wastewater in Kathmandu Valley alone.

Nevertheless, the goal is neither wholly centralized nor decentralized wastewater treatment, he added.

“We have to go the middle route,” he said, with a combination of centralized treatment in Kathmandu’s most densely populated areas and decentralized options for peri-urban areas, institutions and private companies.

GSF’s work in Nepal, aims to impact a total of 1.9 million people, 1.1 million of which currently do not have access to basic sanitation and hygiene. The sub-grantees who were awarded funds are local and national organizations in Nepal, which will focus on the districts of Bajura and Bardiya districts, located in the Far and Mid-Western Development Region of Nepal.

The GSF programme in Nepal, aims to achieve total sanitation coverage in its five target districts, namely: Bajura, Bardiya, Arghakhanchi, Sindhupalchock and Sunsari. Launched in October 2010, the programme is implemented UN-Habitat and its sub-grantees, through using demand creation approaches, such as Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) and strengthening sanitation supply chains, through sanitation marketing approaches.

The Environment, Culture, Agriculture, Research and Development Society, Nepal (ECARDS-Nepal) and Samjhauta were each awarded USD 15,000 to help strengthen the capacity of Local Government officials working at the District, Village Development Committee (VDC),  and Municipality, levels, as well as  civil society members working for non-governmental organization (NGO), to promote sanitation and hygiene. This will be achieved through a range of activities including, delivering CLTS Training of Trainers (ToT) across Bajura and Bardiya - over an eight-month period.

To help achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status across the targeted VDCs and encourage communities to adopt sound hygienic practices, SEBAC and IDS Nepal were selected and awarded USD 130,000 each.  The grants will enable the organisations to coordinate and undertaken sanitation campaigns, involving a wider range of demand creation and supply stimulation activities, to promote behaviour change in relation to sanitation and hygiene in Bajura and Bardiya over the course of the next 15 months. In the same way, Gulariya Municipality and IDS has been awarded a small grant to under a sanitation campaign in Gulariya and Tikapur Municipalities respectively.
In order to support the sector’s increased efforts to coordinate implementation and monitoring activities, SEBAC and ECards- Nepal have also been selected, through the award of a small grant of in the region of USD 16,000 each, to step up efforts to develop the capacity of stakeholder sector coordination and planning at the district level.

Finally, NRCS and RSN were awarded in the region of USD 70,000 each to deliver training and orientation on total sanitation and behavioural change – from school teachers, to communities leaders and other influential local stakeholders in Bajura and Bardiya respectively. In the same way, Samjhauta has been given a small grant of USD 9,000 to work in both Gulariya and Tikapur Municipalities.

“The GSF is very excited that the initial sub-grantees have been identified and agreements are now in place.  This will enable activities to accelerate on the ground in the initial two focus Districts during early 2012.  In addition, sub-grantees are currently being identified in the other GSF focus Districts, and UN- Habitat is confident to have them in place in the first quarter of 2012.  The GSF hopes that this will enable the programme to reach 120 Village Development Committee during the second year of the programme.”

We need to act now”, he added.

Key issues discussed at the meeting were how to improve awareness and capacity of the top level management to make informed decisions for safe schools and hospitals and on the possibilities for retrofitting through ‘retro-maintenance’, where risks are measured as part of the regular maintenance and assets management through relevant data of the health and education institutions.

Specific suggestions from the three countries experts helped improve the draft toolkits in the area of checklists, guidance notes, issue importance, hazard importance, scoring scale and the overall concept and methodology.

The preparation of the Tools are been carried out jointly by UN-Habitat and UN-ISDR with the support of the SCMC and are being field tested by relevant ministries, and other partners.

All of us do know something about the environment, something about going green, something about composting, have heard about rainwater harvesting, about electric cars and have seen Safa tempos on the street of Kathmandu. Yet many of us tend to do two things; first, we complain about Kathmandu ­ the streets are dusty, the garbage is not picked up, Bagmati stinks et cetra. Then, we start pointing fingers saying if only the mayor would do this, if only the Metropolitan Office would do that, if only our politicians would get their act together.</p>
<p style=""color: #555555;"">What am I doing about this city? This is the question you and I should be asking ourselves! Many of us see pollution but ignore solution, whereas both the pollution and solution are in front of our eyes.<span id=""more-533""></span></p>
<p style=""color: #555555;"">Almost 70 per cent of the waste produced in Kathamandu are organic and can be composted easily. If you want to get fancy about it, you can make bio-gas out of it too. There are 300,000 bio-gas plants in Nepal, many of them in rural areas and there is no reason why you can’t have one in your house as well.</p>
<p style=""color: #555555;"">We complain about the river ­ Bagmati, almost all waste water in Bagmati comes from the toilets in our homes. We don’t have many industries heretoilet water is very easy to clean. Put a septic tank, 40-50 per cent of the pollution is gone.</p>
<p style=""color: #555555;"">Air pollution; the solutions are right in front of you.</p>
<p style=""color: #555555;"">Nepal’s first bicycle lane is being constructed. Every Saturday for the past 40 weeks thousands of Kathmanduites have come together to clean Bagmati. It is encouraging to see that things are happening in this city. Things are changing. The question is ­ Are you part of this change or not? Do you want to be part of this change or not?

Martadi VDC office in Bajura yesterday decided to make it compulsory for locals to build toilets in their homes.

Local residents risk being deprived of subsidised rice provided by Nepal Food Corporation, Martadi branch, if they do not build toilets in their houses within a week. Also, power supply is likely to get cut off and a new line will not be connected if households do not have their own toilet.

“We have urged locals to build toilets time and again, but they are negligent,” said VDC Secretary Satyaraj Joshi, of Martadi. According to him, there are 1,265 families in Martadi. Around 1,140 have constructed toilets. As many as 24 VDCs of the district were already declared open defecation free zone while Martadi, Kolti, Jukot and Rugin have not reached that status.

Engineer, Shiva Raj Neupane of Drinking Water and Sanitation Sub-division office, said locals of the four VDCs will be deprived of all government facilities if they do not build toilets. The VDC has issued a notice to the locals that they will not be recommended for citizenship certificates, elderly allowance, birth and death registration, among others from the VDC if they do not build toilets

Hosted jointly by UN-Habitat and Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), the programme was participated by senior government officials, European Union representative, professors and students from academia, professionals, and media reports. The programme started with the opening remarks from Mr. Sunil Karna, Deputy Director General of DUDBC and Mr. Padma Sunder Joshi of UN-Habitat.

Dr. Kitio started with the global urbanization trend, energy crisis and the importance of green building and green cities. He explained the key elements to design green buildings &amp; strategies and methodologies to conceive green future that does not limit to energy but need to incorporate efficient management of resources.

Dr. Kitio advocated UN-Habitat's agenda of planning compact and mixed cities which intend to control sprawl and use vertical space efficiently thereby bringing energy and resource efficiency. Such cities must be planned with due climatic consideration and provide plenty of public spaces, and further be laid out to include residential, commercial and industrial areas within the same neighborhood to the extent possible. Dr. Kitio also talked about resource efficiency strategies and integrated building design for energy efficiency where such integrated building design starts with the minimization of energy needs with appropriate architectural design with the incorporation of energy efficient appliances culminating in the increased use of re
newable energy. Mr. Bhushan Tuladhar from UN-Habitat made vote of thanks for this highly informative presentation of Dr. Kitio and the participants for their interest and queries on the subject.

1288,2/9/2012 12:04,"<strong>KATHMANDU, 9 February 2012 (IRIN)</strong> – In Nepal where one of the biggest childhood killers is water-borne diseases, officials are slowly adopting decentralized ways of treating urban wastewater.

There is currently one fully operational central wastewater treatment plant in Kathmandu, a city of an estimated one million.

Only 12 percent of Nepal’s urban households nationwide have access to sewer networks – with most pipelines draining directly into a river or one of several non-functioning plants – and only 5 percent of wastewater is properly treated, according to the Kathmandu office of UK-based NGO <a style=""color: #5076b6;"" href=""http://www.wateraid.org/documents/plugin_documents/decentralised_wastewater_management_using_constructed_wetlands_in_nepal.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">WaterAid</a>.

<span id=""more-222""></span>Decentralized wastewater treatment systems (DEWATS) in Nepal treat small volumes of wastewater close to the source using low-maintenance, often natural technologies, as opposed to energy intensive central plants, which was the only option until 15 years ago when<a style=""color: #5076b6;"" href=""http://www.enpho.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">a local NGO</a> first installed DEWATS around Kathmandu. “The users are closer to the facility, so the chances of better management are higher,” said Bhushan Tuladhar, the South Asia regional technical adviser for UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT).

The system spreads accountability as well as risk, he added. “When there are lots of different plants, in a way you are not putting all your eggs in one basket.”

Moving wastewater from the source to treatment accounts for some 80 percent of overall treatment costs, according to <a style=""color: #5076b6;"" href=""http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/53/38/42349741.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">experts</a>.

Traditional plants typically use technology that requires skilled technicians, often in short supply in places most in need of wastewater treatment.

Sewerage and drinking water lines are too closely constructed in Kathmandu, which leads to near instantaneous <a style=""color: #5076b6;"" href=""http://web.mit.edu/watsan/Docs/Student%20Theses/Nepal/Wolfe2000.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">water contamination</a> in the case of pipe leakage, which is frequent, said Madhav Pahari, UN Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) water and sanitation specialist in Nepal.

Now a proven technology, experts have successfully lobbied for DEWATS in government policies in recent years, arguing it can decrease water contamination and slash deaths by diarrhoea.

<strong>Pathogens </strong><strong>
</strong>
Water and food-borne diseases accounted for almost 13 percent of outpatient visits (65,000) nationwide in 2009-2010, according to the Department of Health.

In a recently published <a style=""color: #5076b6;"" href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0035920311001659"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">scientific survey</a>, samples taken from a major river running through Kathmandu were “heavily” contaminated with various pathogens, with some levels rivalling those in untreated water in a treatment plant.

With support from the UN, WaterAid and the Asian Development Bank, local NGO Environment and Public Health Organization constructed a community treatment plant in Sunga, 8km southeast of Kathmandu, in 2005 at a cost of US$27,000.

“The site on which the treatment plant was constructed used to be very dirty, with a dilapidated school abandoned after a landslide hit it. We would throw our garbage there,” said Krishna Lal Shrestha, chairman of the local water management committee.

Since then, wastewater from over 80 households filters through beds of coarse sand, gravel and specialized reed plants before being released into a local river.

The plant at Sunga is one of several community based sanitation systems constructed in neighbourhoods in and bordering Kathmandu Valley, which includes the cities of Bhaktapur, Patan and Kathmandu.

Implementation of DEWATS in these communities usually requires building household latrines connected to the drainage network.

After similar community treatment systems were installed in India, open defecation nearly disappeared, health expenditures for women and children decreased by an average 60 percent and school attendance increased significantly, said Pedro Kraemer, programme coordinator for South Asia at the Germany-headquartered Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association (<a style=""color: #5076b6;"" href=""http://www.borda-net.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">BORDA</a>).

<strong>Mainstreaming </strong><strong>
</strong>
Some 30 DEWATS have been constructed mostly in and around Kathmandu over the past 15 years with both public and private funding.

But without strong local governance, it is still premature to decentralize wastewater management, said Pahari. “The [1999] <a style=""color: #5076b6;"" href=""http://www.mld.gov.np/pdf_downloadable_file/local_self_governance_act_2055%281999%29_english.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">local self-governance act</a> talks about decentralization of all basic services, but we don’t have any elected bodies.”

Following a decade-long civil war, declared officially over in 2006, the government has yet to adopt a new constitution. As a consequence, local elections have not taken place.

But Tuladhar from UN-HABITAT said even without locally elected officials, communities can still manage, citing irrigation, education and forestry as examples.

“The city needs to accommodate [its] logistics and infrastructure to a new scenario… and to requirements for maintenance… The problem is essentially one of power,” he said, referring to how the national government is reticent on relinquishing control of wastewater management.

One of the biggest obstacles thus far to replicating DEWATS may be lack of vision, said the government’s director of a small town water supply project in the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage, Ram Deep Sah.

There are at least four different government bodies responsible for wastewater in Kathmandu Valley alone.

Nevertheless, the goal is neither wholly centralized nor decentralized wastewater treatment, he added.

“We have to go the middle route,” he said, with a combination of centralized treatment in Kathmandu’s most densely populated areas and decentralized options for peri-urban areas, institutions and private companies.

1309,12/12/2008 14:51,"Kathmandu, December: ""Everytime when the issue of river pollution is mentioned, people generally blame squatters,"" said Sudip Pulami, secretary of Narayan tole Improvement Committee and added that their community has taken an initiative to manage waste generated from the community within their own settlement. He believes that this practice could be a good example to change public mindset about squatters.

Until a year ago, pungent smell emanating from the polluted Samakhushi River flowing nearby community was causing environmental pollution. Transmissible diseases like diarrhoea, eye shore and dysentery was quite common in the community.Goodness, the squatters soon realised that the habit of open defecation and untreated toilet waste was the major problem creator. They sought help from I/NGOs to get rid of these maladies. Soon, UN-HABITAT, WaterAid Nepal and LUMANTI appeared with technical and financial support to improve sanitation condition in the community.

Two ""Septic tank with up-flow bio-filters"" were built with this support. Each tank has two compartments seperated by a biofilter
that segregates solid waste in the lower chamber allowing liquid waste to pass into the upper chamber. Solid waste left behind decomposes in time, which is used as fertilizer.

""Earlier, most of the squatters used to defecate out in the open at night in the lack of their own private toilets. The handful of households had private toilets, which were also discharging untreated waste into the river,"" said Gita Devi Dhakal, one of the squatters.

Fifteen toilets were constructed in last one year to faciliate every households. Sewer line was laid to connect all the toilets to the septic tanks, which discharge only clean water into the river.

Various organisations agreed to establish the plant in hopes that othersmall towns could replicate it. This is an Asian Development Bank funded Urban and Environment Improvement Project (UEIP).

“The treatment plant has manifold advantages to the community and the area. It is environment friendly; it gives nearly two cylinders of biogas everyday; it yields high-quality compost manure for our crops; and last but not the least, it helps make
our holy rivers and rivulets sacred and clean,” said Rajesh Manandhar, coordinator of Water and Sanitation Department at
UN-HABITAT Water for Asian Cities Programme. In technical jargons, a Community Based Wastewater TreatmentPlant of Reed Bed Treatment System (RBTS) connects a biogas reactor having capacity of 150-cubic metre at Shreekhandapur in Ward No. 9 of the municipality. The system has been established with the technical support of the Environment and Public Health Organisation (ENPHO) and financial support of the UNHABITAT Water for Asian Cities Programme Nepal. The present discharge was 103 cubic metres, but the total capacity in design was 205 cubic metres per day, sources said. “The work has already been completed and the production of biogas will start within a few months as it takes time for fermentation,” Manandhar said.

Kishore Thapa, joint secretary at the Ministry for Physical Planning and Works, said drainage was the main environmental challenge in the urban development. “We are going to replicate this programme in other cities also,” he added. He further said that the government was planning and working for replicating the technology by enabling the management of the wastewater of big cities like Kathmandu.“Now there is a new government and it doesn't accept the proposal for sewage programme until and unless there is a provision of wastewater treatment plant,” he said. The User’s Committee has been provided four ropanis of land worth US$ 26,000 by the municipality and the UN-HABITAT, provided $90,000 financial support for the construction.Government of Nepal, under funding of Asian Development Bank, has implemented Urban and Environment Improvement Project (UEIP) in eight growth nodes cities surrounding Kathmandu valley to address environmental degradation issues caused by rapid urban population growth in Nepal and Dhulikhel Municipality is one of these.

Based on the efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant constructed in Shreekhandapur, around 30 other RBTs will be constructed in these municipalities under UEIP. Lauding the multifaceted benefits of RBWTS, Thapa said that the government would conduct further research on the effectiveness and efficiency of this program to improve the technology for its replication in other municipalities.","Garbage - Source of Biogas, Manure",publish,garbage-source-of-biogas-manure,8/19/2014 15:49

developed by Phuxin Citizen in China, was introduced in Nepal by a group of engineers some three years ago,according to Prof Dr. Jagannath Shrestha of Center for Energy Studies at Institute of Engineering of Tribhuvan University (CES/IoE/TU) which has tested the technology for over six months. The experiment showed the technology to be cost-effective.""Authorities are busy playing blame game and politics on degradable waste but not initiating any model to solve the problem,"" said Shrestha.

It costs only Rs. 80,000 to install a 10 feet by 10 feet plant which can generate enough cooking gas to fulfill the needs of a family with 5 to 7 members from only one kg waste in a day. Since it comes with a 25-year guarantee one can recover the cost involved in just three years, says Shrestha. According to CES/IoE/TU, over last the three years, more than 100 individuals from the bureaucracy, private and community institutions, including 12 municipalities, have been given practical training in installing the plant at Kalimati Vegetable and Fruits Market (KVFM) by feeding it the waste generated in the area. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) Small Grants Programs of the United Nations Development Program, and UN-Habitat were also involved in the project. In its initial phase, some two-and-half years back, a feasibility study was also conducted by the government and the study showed that this was a practicable option for urban areas.

But it is being used in generating biogas. She along with her community members has built toilets of their own to end the open defecation as well. It has changed the perception of their neighbour communities who used to discriminate and blame them for causing environment pollution.

The community constructed a biogas plant with support of UNHABITAT Water for Asian Cities Programme Nepal, WaterAid
Nepal and LUMANTI. The plant produces biogas mainly from toilet waste and other degradable waste. The community people have now started using gas stoves that replaced their traditional cooking stoves.

""These gas stoves are more convenient as it is easy to operate,"" Sangeeta Bika, another inhabitant of Lankhu Community said.Since these gas stoves emit less smoke, it has improved in-house environment and reduced health problem such as eye shore and other respiratory disorders. It has also minimized community dependency on fuel wood.

According to Bika, the biogas plant has also saved her time and money, which she had to spend in managing fuel wood. She can now fulfill other daily necessities with the time and money she saved.

The community has formed a biogas users' committee to take care of the constructed biogas plant that has managed gas supply to 17 households and a local restaurant in Lankhu. Currently, the biogas is being supplied for 6 hours twice a day.

The community people constructed 17 private toilets and connected it with the digester of the biogas plant. The plant produces gas with this toilet waste.

""There was only one public toilet in Lankhu, which was insufficient for community population. After toilet construction, every household have toilet of their own. Members of Lankhu communty use their own toilets. An open defecation is no more visible around, which has reduced environmental pollution,"" Heera Thapa, President of Biogas User Committee uttered.

The committee earns NRs. 3600/- every month by collecting NRs. 200/- from each gas user. Hence generated amount is then used for operation and maintenance of the plant.

Since the sludge excreted after gas production has been used as compost in farmland, the biogas plant has also become a blessing for these community members that has helped them increase agricultural productivity.

to accelerate creeping movement of sanitation sector. The year was celebrated worldwide by the global communities and Nepal
also showed its solidarity with this global initiative by formulating Nepal Country Plan for IYS – 2008.

Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS), under the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) formed the Steering Committee for National Sanitation Action (SCNSA) and established IYS-2008 Nepal Desk for the implementation of activities envisioned by IYS 2008. UN-HABITAT Water for Asian Cities (WAC) Programme Nepal also showed its team spirit and supported DWSS in this process.

A Master Plan on Hygiene and Sanitation, and National Urban Water and Sanitation Policy are being formulated to fulfill the lacking of a comprehensive vision document on hygiene and sanitation, and to address the emerging crisis of urban sanitation.

Nepal along with other participating countries also made its commitments to recognize access to water supply and sanitation
as the basic right at the Third South Asian Conference on Sanitation (SACOSAN). Similarly, political leaders and policy makers of Nepal expressed their willingness to promote sanitation sector by making their commitment in one voice at a Mega Event held in Kathmandu. It has assured to prioritize sanitation as one of the major issues of national importance in the new constitution of Nepal. Its because of growing concern and commitments of government, policy makers and political leaders,Government of Nepal has now begun to allocate a separate budget for sanitation promotion recognizing the social, economic and health implications of sanitation.

IYS Nepal Desk has organized several trainings on different sanitation issues and activities including School Led Total Sanitation (SLTS) and Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) were also organized at national, district and community level to make the IYS – 2008 momentous. It has esteemed stakeholders to develop and implement own local level Plan of Action on sanitation promotion. Currently, SLTS has been implemented in 46 schools of the Chitwan District and 9 schools have already declared its catchments totally open defecation free zones. By learning the lesson from these activities, stakeholders of Tanahau and Pyuthan district are also developing the local level master plans for their districts to achieve cent percent sanitation coverage by 2012 and 2013 respectively.

Different events such as World Water Day, Global Hand Washing Day, National Sanitation Week, Nepal WASH Campaign and Regional Workshop on Ecological Sanitation organized in IYS 2008 have also made the sanitation consequential.

As government agencies, UN Agency, International/Non-Government Organizations (I/NGOs) and community workedcordially while implementing WESH programme activities, the programme reveals a good example of cooperation among different stakeholders.

Speaking at the programme, Joint Secretary at Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) Suman Sharma opined that the Government agencies, I/NGOs and community must work together in order to extend safe drinking water and sanitation facilities.

Coordinator of Health Sector Reform Unit at Ministry of Health (MoH) Baburam Marasini believed that WATSAN is not an issue of a single ministry as unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation directly influence the public health. Hence, there should be interministerial coordination to improve WATSAN sector – he said.

Non-governmental organizations usually undertake projects on a pilot basis and they can not do it on mass scale although their works have proven to be innovative and cost effective. “Therefore, the government should take the initiative to replicate such projects on a mass scale to increase access to safe water and improve sanitation,” said Dr. Roshan Raj Shrestha, Chief Technical Advisor of UNHABITAT.

Mr. Sanjaya Adhikary, Country Director , WaterAid Nepal Said “In order to achieve universal access, the water and sanitation sector,besides improving its activities, needs an increased budget of at least $23 million. At present however the sector is only
able to utilize 67% of its allocated budget. It therefore needs an improvement in policy to be able to achieve better results.
He announced that this year, for the first time, a separate sanitation budget has been allocated.

Since majority of urban dwellers, especially urban poor are still distance away from safe drinking water and proper sanitation (WATSAN), UN-HABITAT and WAN jointly launched WESH Programme in 2007 in Nepal through local partner NGOs viz. LUMANTI and CIUD in close collaboration with local authorities and communities. The programme piloted various WATSAN activities in three diverse urban/ peri-urban locations of the country viz. Lubhoo in Lalitpur, Narayantole in Kathmandu and Bharatpur that improved the water, sanitation and hygiene situation of these communities.

Some exemplary works has been done in these communities.As an example, in Bharatpur Municipality, the programme conceptualized and established a community level biogas system at Lankhu –a squatter community of 17 households.
This biogas system not only takes care of the waste and wastewater of the community but also of the solid waste from the neighbouring community. It has improved neighborhood environment in Lankhu and contributed towards local livelihood opportunities. Likewise, a community owned and managed decentralized water supply system has also been established in Jakhadimai. Another example can be taken of the up-flow bio-filter piloted in Narayantole to treat the wastewater from about 20 households. A major milestone has been the establishment of a slaughter house at Hyumat of Kathmandu.","Water, Environmental Sanitation and Hygiene Programme Dissemination Workshop in Kathmandu",publish,water-environmental-sanitation-and-hygiene-programme-dissemination-workshop-in-kathmandu,8/19/2014 16:44

Their involvement at these events and the commitment they made during these events reflected the growing interest of the government and political leaders on water, sanitation and climate change issues, and ensured stakeholders and others to endorse these issues properly in new constitution of Nepal.

The Water Week Organizing Committee, a committee formed to coordinate the Water Week 2009, organized a two-day “Water Exhibition” for mass sensitization on water related topics. Information dissemination during these events helped over 2000 people to increase their knowledge on water and climate related issues. Likewise, the presentations and documentary films further helped to disseminate information on subject matters.

Information on water related issues were disseminated widely by performing street drama entitled “Water: Our Life” at three places of Kathmandu Valley. An Inter School Art Competition on “Importance of Water and its' Scarcity” had also been organized to sensitize students on water related issues and disseminate the information on water and climate change from educational institutions as well.

This intervention is envisaged to supplement the activities of the Sind Cities Improvement Investment Programme (SCIIP), Government of Sindh so that the quality,reliability and coverage of water supply, wastewater and solid waste management services can be improved in project covered cities.

Hence, these Master Trainers will incorporate their skills that they gained from the training in Nepal to accelerate the ongoing developmental activities in these cities covered by SCIIP. They will help to develop training material to conduct training programmes on water, sanitation and hygiene issues in Pakistan. The resource materials and other relevant materials developed by UN HABITAT and other agencies will be used as references for this purpose. In addition, they will assist inraising mass awareness by developing various IEC materials like audio-visual aids.

They will also organize Training of Trainers (ToT) in Pakistan to those selected from the target schools, government agencies, stakeholders, health workers, local Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Community Based Organizations (CBSs) to produce trainers, who will conduct capacity building activities on water, sanitation and hygiene issues for various audiences and groups, and facilitate and promote the water, sanitation and hygiene activities at educational institutions and communities. These master trainers will provide technical support and necessary guidance to those trainers to establish water classroom, which will be
developed as learning centre of several water and sanitation technologies such as rainwater harvesting, solid waste management system including biogas, wastewater treatment system, drinking water quality improvement options and simple field-level water testing kits.","Pakistani Officials trained on Water, Environmental Sanitation and Hygiene Education",publish,pakistani-officials-trained-on-water-environmental-sanitation-and-hygiene-education,8/19/2014 17:07

In Nepal, the government and non-government organizations, and other institutions involved in water, environment and sanitation sectors organized different programmes in different part of the country to mark the WED 2009.

On this occasion, UN-HABITAT Water for Asian Cities (WAC) programme, Nepal, Bottlers Nepal Limited, Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) and Urban Environment Management Society (UEMS) jointly organized a programme in Lalitpur to declare three communities- Chhusika, Chochein and Lonhala as the Safe Water Zones. At the programme, the community representatives were honoured with certificate of appreciation by the Chief Guest and Head of Water Quality Improvement and Monitoring Section of Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS), Birendra Man Shakya.

Waterborne diseases such as cholera, diarrhea was common among community people in Safe Water Zone declared areas due to lack of safe drinking water. Hence, ""Partnership for Safe Water"" campaign - a unique private public partnership initiated by Government of Nepal, UN HABITAT, Bottlers Nepal, ENPHO and UEMS, was intervened in these communities. The programme promoted simple Household Water Treatment (HWT) options such as boiling, filtration, chlorination and SODIS, and conducted various awareness raising programmes to increase public awareness on safe drinking water. Nowadays, none of community people drinks water without disinfecting it, which has remarkably decreased the waterborne diseases.

On the same occasion, an Inter-School Art Competition on the theme ""Waterborne Diseases and its preventive measures"" had also been organized. The winners of the competition were honoured with prize and certificate by Dr. Roshan Raj Shrestha, Chief Technical Advisor of UN HABITAT.

On WED 2009, UN-HABITAT WAC and Nepal and Bottlers Nepal Limited also entered into a partnership exhibiting Public-Private-Community partnership to conserve and preserve the environment. This collaboration will work in cooperation with Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City (LSMC) and Kathmandu Valley Water Management Board where as Centre for Integrated Urban Development will provide technical support.

It has aimed to demonstrate community level groundwater recharge technique in Patan, Lalitpur through restoration of traditional ponds and installation of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) system and groundwater recharge structures to facilitate increase in water discharge of selectedtraditional stone spout.

The initiative will help to conserve 40,000 kilo liters of rainwater, besides benefiting the local community and opinion leaders to build awareness on Water Conservation and protecting traditional water bodies.",WAC Activities marking World Water Day 2009 in Nepal,publish,wac-activities-marking-world-water-day-2009-in-nepal,8/19/2014 17:12
1354,8/31/2009 17:14,"Scarcity of drinking water is not new for denizens of Kathmandu Valley. Water supplied by Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL) is far behind the demand of the people. Therefore, people use water from local sources such as stone spouts, dug-wells and springs to fulfill their demand. However, these sources are also drying gradually with the depletion in ground aquifer. Ground aquifer is the major source for these local water sources, and the main causing of declining ground water level is it's over extraction.

Considering it, UN HABITAT Water for Asian Cities Programme Nepal launched two projects in the valley in August 2009 to manage drinking water at local level and recharge ground water. The launching programme of these projects were inaugurated by Andre Dzikus, Chief of Water and Sanitaiton Section II, Water, Sanitation and Infrastructure Branch, UN HABITAT, Nairobi

UN HABITAT made an understanding with LUMANTI Support Group for Shelter to provide its technical as well as financial support to establish isolated water supply system and pro-poor distribution mechanism to provide safe and affordable drinking water to the poor and marginalized inhabitants of selected communities.

This project was initiated officially by organizing a launching programme on 15 August, 2009 in Tokha. The project as its first component will tap water from streams located in Shivapuri National Park, which will be then treated and distributed in Saraswoti and Chandeshwori VDC of Tokha through the distribution network. As the surface water available is not sufficient to meet the demand, the project will also extract water from ground aquifer.

In addition to water supply facilities, it will develop a comprehensive sanitation master plan of Tokha through consultations and consensus of all stakeholders to guide the future sanitation improvement plan in integrated manner.

District Development Committee- Kathmandu, Saraswoti and Chandeshwori VDC has also made their solidarity by allocating budget for the establishment of water supply system in Tokha, and the project will get other necessary technical supports from Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL).

The project has also targeted to access safe drinking water to about 1200 households of low income communities in Koteshwor. A distribution centre will be established, which will deliver the filtered drinking water in 20 litre polythene container in these communities.

A water bottling system had been established in Chyasal, Lalitpur with technical and financial support of UN HABITAT, which is currently serving treated water to 250 households. This new project will install additional treatment plant to the existing water bottling system to cater safe drinking water to addtional 100 households in the area.

Similarly, UN HABITAT and Bottlers Nepal Limited in collaboration with Lalitpur Sub-metropolitan City, Bentleys University, National Trust for Nature Conservation and in technical support of Centre for Integrated Urban Development launched another project on 16 August, 2009 in Lalitpur to demonstrate community rainwater recharge technique through restoration of traditional pond, installation of rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge structure to facilitate increase in water discharge of selected traditional stone spouts.

It has been expected to conserve 40,000 kilo liters of rain water, besides benefiting the local community and opinion leaders to build awareness on water conservation and protection of traditional water bodies.",UN HABITAT launched projects in Nepal for conservation and management of water sources,publish,un-habitat-launched-projects-in-nepal-for-conservation-and-management-of-water-sources,8/19/2014 17:17

However, rivers in the urban zones of developing countries are getting polluted rapidly in these days.

The river pollution is also appearing as a critical problem in Kathmandu Valley. The chronically polluted Bagmati River and its tributaries have been causing environmental pollution and increasing threat on public health. Despite being major river system with aesthetic and high religious value, it has been turning into open sewage and disposal site of solid waste. Besides, sand extraction from the river and encroachment of river banks by squatters and others are degrading natural phenomena and narrowing the river system.

However, a serious lack of planning, regulations, enforcement, and implementation of appropriate and effective programmes has been realized in this regard. The Ministerial Cabinet of Government of Nepal ratified Bagmati Actional Plan (BAP) on 11 August, 2009 and approved the five-year plan as the official framework document for the development of river system of Kathmandu Valley. The plan had been prepared by Bagmati Civilization Integrated Development Committee (BCIDC), National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC) with technical and financial support of UN HABITAT Water for Asian Cities Programme Nepal and United Nation Environment Programme (UNEP) to address the complicated issues of Bagmati conservation.

The Bagmati Action Plan is a five year project that aims to clean the Bagmati river system and its tributaries. Based on the population density, the plan has classified the valley into five different zones- Natural Conservation Core Zone (the hills around the valley), Rural Zone (outermost area of the valley), Peri-urban Zone (area lying between rural and urban core area of the valley), Urban Zone (five municipalities of the valley) and Downstream Zone (from Sundarighat to Katuwal Daha), in order to address the issues of river pollution at micro level, and proposed different activities for different zones.

It has recommended conventional waste water management system for urban core zone. Likewise, Decentralized Wastewater Treatment System (DWTS) has been explained as a new approach for rural and peri-urban zones. The rehabilitation of the existing wastewater treatment plants at different locations of the valley has also been included.

In context of improving environmental sanitation and reducing river pollution at Natural Conservation Core Zone and Urban Zone, the plan has given top priority to onsite sanitation including technologies such as ECOSAN toilet. It has included the faecal sludge management with high priority in some areas as well.

The Bagmati Action Plan has prioritized the promotion of rainwater harvesting, and rehabilitation of existing dug-wells and ponds to recharge ground water with rainwater. The land purchasing and building construction nearby river banks of Bagmati, Nakkhu and Manohara Rivers will be prohibited. According to the plan, the squatter settlement on river banks of peri-urban and urban zone will be relocated and resettled, and the river banks will be protected using bioengineering.

This meeting has helped to support the initiatives taken in the fifteenth SAARC Summit held in Colombo in August 2008 where the summit declaration had re-emphasized the need to harness rainwater for development and sustainability and had urged countries to take appropriate action.

The programme was inaugurated on 28 June 2009 by Honorable Prime Minister Mr. Madhav Kumar Nepal. Addressing the programme, he told that the utilization of rain water as a renewable source is very important in the context of growing requirements of Nepal. In his opinion, rain water can be a very feasible and convenient option for daily water use. He believed that rainwater can be a viable source of water supply in hills and urban areas to lessen the problem of water scarcity and added that there is an immense probability of collecting, preserving and using water from the rain in Nepal. He, then, informed that the Government of Nepal has been putting all possible efforts to meet the daunting task of providing access to safe water to all citizens by 2017. He requested the countries in the region to join hands in making concerted efforts to promote co-operation in tapping rainwater for mutual and multiple benefits.

At the meeting, the secretaries, senior policy makers and officials of the participating SAARC countries shared their field experiences and research results on technical, social, ecological and economic aspects of RWH, and discussed to explore the potential of using rainwater for drinking, groundwater recharge and for other domestic applications. The current policies and guidelines adopted in the regional countries were also discussed upon. In addition, discussions were also held on very important aspects of RWH like the water quality, private sector participant among others.

In addition to the discussions on different aspects of RWH, the participants also had the opportunity of observing some demonstrative activities on RWH in Kathmandu. Out of the seven sites selected for the field visit, five sites were established with support from UN-HABITAT. The participants were impressed with the initiatives of the local community and the enthusiasm shown by them in preserving their traditional water management systems where they are actively involved in capturing rainwater in augmenting the groundwater table.

The meeting concluded on the third day with 9-point recommendation that has advised the regional countries to keep indigenous knowledge and skills in consideration while designing and constructing rainwater harvesting system. It has also suggested to form the South Asia Networking Center for regional cooperation for rainwater harvesting. The recommendation has also emphasized the Private Public Partnership (PPP) to explore cost-effective option of rainwater harvesting so as to enhance sustainability of water supply services in the region.

The recommendation was handed over to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Planning and Works Mr. Bijay Kumar Gachedar at the closing ceremony of the meeting. Addressing the function, he said that the rainwater could play an important role to enhance water security both in rural and urban areas. He said that the government would continue to work to provide safe water supply for all.

An exhibition on RWH and other water related issues had also been organized during the same event. A photo exhibition reflecting different technologies of rainwater harvesting was also organized supported by UN-HABITAT and GUTHI. The best three photos selected through viewers votes were awarded by Mr. Gachedar at the closing function.",Regional High Level Rainwater Harvesting Meeting held in Kathmandu,publish,regional-high-level-rainwater-harvesting-meeting-held-in-kathmandu,8/19/2014 17:39

The day had been celebrated worldwide this year with a common theme ""Planning for a better urban future"".

The local government, civil society organizations and local community in six cities including Biratnagar, Bharatpur, Birgunj, Hetauda, Itahari and Kalaiya are working together to plan and taking actions to make these cities a better place to live for all and particularly the poor. This seminar had been held to share successful experiences of these cities in housing the poor and improving access to basic facilities such as water and sanitation, with policy makers and other stakeholders so that lessons learnt would pave the path towards planning for a better urban future.

Addressing the inauguration programme, Assistant Minister for the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works Kalawati Devi Pasawan requested all the stakeholders to keep poor and backwarded groups in prime consideration while implementing their shelter programme activities. She assured that the government of Nepal and political parties will provide support to the activities initiated to provide shelter to target groups.

Director General of Department of Urban Development and Building Construction Indra Bahadur Shrestha informed that the government will re-establish the squatters by providing them an alternative shelters. According to him, the process has already been initiated in Siraha, Saptari and Kapilvastu districts. He further added that the government has allocated a separate budget for this purpose.

Prafulla Man Pradhan, Programme Manager of UN HABITAT Nepal, believed that poor management of water and sanitation, and increasing environmental pollution is the drawback of unmanaged urban growth in Nepal. In his opinion, unplanned urbanization is the root cause of increasing crime and corruption in these cities.

Chief Technical Advisor for South Asia Region, UN HABITAT Dr. Roshan Raj Shrestha said that urban environmental pollution is a major factor contributing climate change, which is caused by uncontrolled and unmanaged urban development.

Karuna Paul, Country Director of Habitat for Humanity requested all stakeholders to implement shelter development activities in squatter and slum communities. Research and Advocacy Manager of WaterAid Nepal, Rabin Lal Shrestha told that the lessons learnt from experiences and challenges in big cities should be taken into consideration while planning for further urban development.

Minister Bhattarai said this while inaugurating a three-day workshop organized by Government of Nepal\ Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (GoN\ WECS) with support of UN HABITAT Water for Asian Cities (WAC) Programme Nepal and in cooperation of Gender Water Alliance (GWA) to enhance awareness on gender mainstreaming in WATSAN sector. According to him, the GoN has formulated short term, mid term and long term plans under the National Water Plan to extend drinking water facility throughout the country.

Kishore Thapa, secretary at WECS told that the plans and policies should be prepared with an integrated approach to ensure equal participation of men and women in all sectors related to water resources including drinking water, hydropower, tourism, irrigation, industries, fish farming, transportation and others.

Dr. Roshan Raj Shrestha, chief technical advisor of South Asia Region, UN HABITAT opined that gender mainstreaming is not being given much priority in practice though the issue of women participation is generally raised as a hot topic for discussion. He stressed on the need of formulating women inclusive action plans in WATSAN sector, and adoption of appropriate strategies for its effective implementation.

At the workshop, representatives from more than 30 WATSAN organizations particularly from government agencies, municipalities and non-government organizations were oriented on gender related issues. The workshop also discussed on current situation of gender in WATSAN sector in Nepal. They were also helped to identify the gender related problems in WATSAN sector, and trained to draft the organizational action plans with reference to gender mainstreaming.

At the end of the workshop, the participants made a common commitment to advocate ensuring gender integration at their respective organization, programme and intervention levels, . And each participants of the workshop also prepared action plans for their organizations.

The programme was launched officially by the Constitution Assembly member Krishna Prasad Sapkota on 7 September, 2009 in Dhulikhel.

Addressing the launching programme, Sapkota said that the developmental activities should be planned and implemented properly for the sustainable development of Nala. He further added that the household centered environmental sanitation programme will be the foundation to the improvement of environmental sanitation in the village.

Chief Technical Advisor of UN-Habitat, South Asia, Dr. Roshan Raj Shrestha advised the local residents of Nala to give top priority to the planning phase while preparing the sanitation plan. Further, he said that they should give up the tradition top down approach of planning and that the households and communities should be placed at the center of the planning, identification of technologies and during implementation.

""Local people will be involved from planning to implementation phase of household centered environmental sanitation programme in Nala"", said Padma Sundar Joshi, Executive Director of Center for Integrated Urban Development (CIUD). He told that most of programmes in Nepal fail to meet its objectives because the target groups are not given prime consideration at the time of planning.

The household centered environmental sanitation plan will be conducted in ten steps in Nala, said Mingma Gyalzen Sherpa of EAWAG who is coordinating and providing technical support to the HCES programme. As part of the planning process, the programme will assess the baseline sanitation conditions, needs and priorities of individual households and community; identify appropriate sanitation options, and finally draft the environmental sanitation plan. All these steps involve users’ participation from the very beginning. The programme initiated in Nala is currently in its fifth stage, said Mingma Sherpa.

The HCES approach is being implemented with technical and financial support of UN HABITAT and the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) in partnership with CIUD and the Nala Integrated Development Committee at the local level. Similar HCES programmes are being implemented in other locations around the world, one in Costa Rica , Central America, one in Burkinas Faso, West Africa, two in East Africa and two in Asia by EAWAG. The HCES approach places households, communities and neighborhood at the centre of the planning process, adopting participatory processes from planning until the implementation stage and in the sustainable operation and management of the infrastructures established. It encompasses an integrated approach where safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene are addressed simultaneously.

The situation is even worse, when it comes about sanitation. The gap between sanitation and water supply facilities at national level is distinct, with 46 percent coverage of latrines and 76 percent coverage of basic water supply.

Government of Nepal (GoN) has announced its National Goal with the target to reach 100 percent water and sanitation coverage by 2017. However, most of the efforts from government and non-government agencies have primarily focused towards reaching rural beneficiaries. Urban poor are not getting priority as they are often neglected or assumed to be privileged with basic services.

Hence, these inhabitants of urban and peri-urban areas are still deprived from adequate water and sanitation (WATSAN) facilities, and are living in degrading urban environment.

UN HABITAT Water for Asian Cities Programme Nepal and Water Aid Nepal has recently made an agreement to launch a project titled ‘Integrated Water and Sanitation Services to the urban poor communities in Kamalamai and Itahari Municipalities in Nepal.

Both of these municipalities had recently completed Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded Small Town Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (STWSSSP) through Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS). Similarly, ADB funded Urban Environment Improvement Project (UEIP) is going on in Kamalamai. by Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC).

In both project areas, DUDBC is also conducting poverty mapping, gender assessment and need identification project with support of UN HABITAT.

The project will select the poor clusters in these two municipalities on the basis of poor households and clusters identified by poverty mapping recently completed by DUDBC to intervene the project. It will prioritize its activities on the basis of the projects identified by need identification study. In total around 16,000 urban poor population will be benefited by the project.

The project has been expected to prepare participatory water, sanitation and hygiene improvement plans for the selected communities of both municipalities. It will be supportive in improving heath and sanitation situation in addition to increasing sanitation practices of the target communities, which demonstrate good practices and technologies for replication in other municipal areas. It will increase awareness and capacities of government and non-government actors to deliver adequate WATSAN services so as to increase coverage of WATSAN services.

The project will facilitate municipalities; develop Water, Environmental Sanitation and Hygiene Improvement (WESHI) Plan for the selected communities; and disseminate learning experiences to institutionalize pro poor governance at municipal level.

Based on the WESHI plan, the project will construct new and improve existing 90 water points along with the rehabilitation of 7 water supply schemes to increase coverage of water supply.

Similarly, it will construct 750 latrines at household level, 350 in Itahari and 400 in Kamalamai; and rehab drainage systems for improving neighbourhood environmental sanitation with an aim of total sanitation and providing access of maximum people to improved sanitation. It has also planned to declare open defecation free to 13 communities as well.

The project will raise awareness on WATSAN issues, and promote proper water, sanitation and hygiene practices to improve health condition of inhabitants. It will initiate ""Water Safety Plan"" at community level for preventing water sources from contamination. The plan will be promoted integrating sanitation and hygiene promotion so that holistic approach could be undertaken to ensure proper water and sanitation services in the area.

Nala is a peri urban settlement located in Kavre district close to Banepa Municipality. The main objective of the bazaar, according to Mr. Mingma
Gyalzen Sherpa, is to disseminate knowledge on different sanitation systems so that locals or households can take informed decisions while selecting sanitation systems for their household and community.

Mr. Sherpa is a PhD researcher at AIT/EAWAG who is technically backstopping the HCES project. Currently,the inhabitants of Nala are preparing a HCES plan for their settlement under the technical and financial support of UN-HABITAT and the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Sciences (EAWAG)/SANDEC. The Center for Integrated Urban Development (CIUD) is the local implementing partner.

“As part of the planning process the people in Nala are at the stage of selecting potential sanitation options appropriate for their households and the community”, informed Mr. Sherpa. The HCES plan will be covering four wards of Nala Village Development Committee with a total of 388 households.

HCES is a novel planning approach which places households, communities and neighborhood at the centre of the planning process, adopting participatory processes from planning to implementation. It encompasses an integrated approach where safe water
supply, sanitation and hygiene are addressed simultaneously. The centre to the HCES planning approach is the 10 step planning process. The key steps include assessment of user priorities, identification of technological and feasible service combination options and formulation of a consolidated urban sanitation service plan in collaboration with the local stakeholders.The day long bazaar was witnessed by over 1000 people, says Mr. Shyam Sundar Shrestha, Chairperson of the Nala Integrated Development Committee. Several sanitation options such as Urine Diversion Systems, Double Pit Latrines, Septic Tanks, Decentralized
systems such as Biogas, Constructed Wetlands, urine reuse option through Struvite (Phosphorous abstraction) and water disinfection options such as SODIS, Piyush, Biosand filters were demonstrated in the bazaar. In addition to the these options traditional sanitation practices such as the practice of making organic compost “sagaa”, source separation practices using
“copra” and innovative approaches like recycled handmade plastic products, tissue culture techniques were put up by the local women and youth groups.

According to Mr. Prabhat Kiran Ranjit, the coordinator of the event from CIUD says, the overwhelming participation in Nala was triggered by the community clean up campaign organized early in the morning and most importantly by people’s quest for knowledge. “We will adopt this approach in our other HCES projects as well since it is an interactive way of informing the public”,

The project has recently formulated a 20-year WATSAN Plan. It has recommended various WATSAN activities to conduct in selected poor communities of these municipalities and small towns, which requires sufficient fund support. The resource mapping workshop had been held to identify the possible resources, which can be supportive to implement WATSAN plan in the project
areas.

The workshop carried out stakeholders' consultation on existing WATSAN situation in municipalities, various constraints to bring additional support from other potential stakeholders and donors. The workshop also focused on role of different level sector players in the implementation of WATSAN plan, and exploration of possible financial and other resources.At the programme, Joint Secretary at Ministry of Local Development (MoLD) Dinesh Thapaliya told thatpopulation living under poverty line has increased in the country in last few decades though it seems reduced in proportion. Speaking about the small scale grants, he opined that MoLD should provide grant to those local governments, which assure the ministry to give prime consideration to water, sanitation and health sector. Dormani Poudel, president of MuAN told that local  government should place solid waste management at top
priority position in their action plan at the time of approaching to the donors. He suggested the participating municipal representatives and WATSAN stakeholders to get united to contribute WATSAN sector.

The participants at the workshop, highlighting the existing urban WATSAN problems and current strategies of local governments, suggested to assemble support from various resources for the effective implementation of WATSAN action plans at local level. They also suggested to make local government accountable and capable to implement WATSAN activities independently.",Municipal Resource Mapping Workshop held in Nepal,publish,municipal-resource-mapping-workshop-held-in-nepal,8/19/2014 18:27
1796,9/24/2014 16:50,"New York, 23 September 2014: National and local governments, mayors, financial institutions, and private sector companies have made robust commitments to the fight against climate change as the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon, highlighted cities as one of the key areas of action that need attention.

Mr Ban was speaking at the Climate Change Summit taking place at the UN Headquarters, announcing several key commitments being made today by the world’s nations and cities.

“Today a coalition of more than 200 mayors, representing 400 million people, will sign a Mayor’s Compact to reduce annual emissions by between 12.4 and 16.4 per cent,” said Mr Ban in his press conference highlighting the main announcements of the day.

In his statement, Mr Ban said that he hoped for solid actions to come from the meeting, rather than just talking, a sentiment echoed by Dr Joan Clos, UN-Habitat Executive Director in his opening at the City Policy Room session.

“What is more important than our contribution is our willingness to think together and work towards adaptation and resilience,” he said. “[We have a] double responsibility – to diminish the greenhouse gas emissions in cities – especially in the developing world – and a high responsibility to protect our citizens against risks of climate change.”

In contrast to many previous UN conferences, the Summit has focused on the inclusion of institutional partners, international organisations and in particular financial institutions and the private sector, with a strong focus on mobilising finance for climate change action.

One such case, the Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance, also announced today, is a coalition of organisations, countries and private sector companies established to leverage the funds needed to bridge the estimated USD1 trillion gap needed for low-carbon and climate resilient infrastructure in urban areas.

The call for greener urban mass transportation also came across clearly during the Summit, with a commitment to increase the number of electric vehicles in cities to least 30 per cent of all new vehicles sold on annual basis by 2030 while simultaneously developing the enabling infrastructure for their effective use through the Urban Electric Mobility Initiative (UEMI). The initiative is supported by private companies including Chinese car manufacturer BYD, Mahindra Reva, and Michelin, one of the two largest tire manufacturers in the world, as well as UN-Habitat.

According to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a shift towards sustainable transport is essential to prevent greenhouse gas emissions by transport from doubling by the middle of the century and to achieve the internationally agreed goal of a maximum 2 degrees Celsius rise in global average temperature.

In a visual analogy, the Head of the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Christina Figueres described action against climate change as a cart being pulled by two oxen: “One oxen is cities, one is the private sector,” she said. “Cities are at the nexus between government and citizens as well as the nexus between the public and private sectors.”",City actors commit to action at UN Climate Summit,publish,city-actors-commit-to-action-at-un-climate-summit,9/24/2014 16:50

During this period women face lots of physical and mental problems while living in these types of houses. The serious problem which they face is the insecurity problem and even there has been news of rape case during chaupadi. During that time they are not provided nutritious food like milk and fruits. People believe if they are provided milk, the cow will stop giving milk; likewise trees will stop bearing fruits if the fruits are given to them. These women nonetheless have to carry out tough tasks like fetching water, collecting fodders, cleaning animal sheds, working in the fields and doing other heavy work during that time.

This tradition of chaupadi is now becomming a barrier to the ongoing ODF campaign which has been initiated by GSF Nepal and now has adopted an innovative approach to create awareness on chaupadi and declare it has chaupadi free zone. For this kuldevmandu VDC of Bajura district has been declared chaupadi free zone.

They discussed on how the constructed toilets for the Oral Therapeutic Center (OTP) can be sustained for long and can be used regularly in future. Different ideas shared by different people. Some said the health center should request to the district authorities. Some other pessimists said no fund is available for operation and maintenance. The contrarian view came from the crowd. Why not to contribute from ourselves whatever we can? Almost 30 people were gathered there. Why not? The idea worked. Then, people started to collect from individual level. Finally they were made able to collect five thousand and five rupees in just 4-5 minutes for operation and maintenance of the WASH Facilities that was build as part of CERF Project. Then, everyone realized that if felt possible, then it definitely becomes possible. ―CERF Project has built WASH facilities for saving lives of hundred of our children and women. It would be a shame it we could not do such efforts from our community level. Today I feel privilege to contribute for this effort.‖ Said by Mr. Kashi Raj Gautam, VDC-Secretary, Dhadwar.

Similar efforts were also made from different community people on different communities.

Centre under Ministry of Local Development (SWMRMC/ MoLD) from 15-18 February 2010 to understand issues and challenges faced by municipalities. The workshop had been expected to be helpful to introduce and motivate municipalities to adopt cost effective, efficient and environment friendly new technologies to improve solid waste management at local level.

Speaking about the trend of progress of municipal SWM in Nepal, Ashok Shahi, Engineer of SWMRMC/ MoLD told that lack of adequate laws &amp; legislations, weakness in institution arrangements, inefficient use of existing resources, lack of technology transfer &amp; appropriate technologies are the major challenges in municipal SWM in the country.

At the workshop, a team of experts on SWM had been invited from UN Habitat Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) to orient the participants to different SWM technologies- being implemented in Japan, so that municipalities of Nepal could adopt appropriate technology to overcome SWM problems. Sachiyo Hoshino, Special Adviser to the Director, UN Habitat ROAP, while speaking about the municipal SWM in Japan, told that 78 percent of solid waste produced is incinerated, while remaining 20 percent is recycled. Youiko Taira and Nobuko Hatano from UN Habitat ROAP trained the participants on cardboard composting technique, which can be applicable to manage degradable solid waste at its source and reduce production of solid waste.

The workshop also shared various successful practices municipal SWM of Nepal, and discussed on the issues and challenges, the municipalities are facing due to unmanaged solid waste. The experts from UN Habitat ROAP, Japan also presented a paper about the SWM system of Fukuoka City, Japan to guide the participating municipalities in dealing with the problems related to SWM.

1645,5/18/2010 12:30,"On Monday 17th of May 2010 the “Urine Bank” in Siddhipur, Nepal was inaugurated. The urine bank, which is a spin-off from the STruvite recovery from Urine in Nepal (STUN), is a pilot project aimed at increasing the re-use of nutrients from human urine. Source-separated urine is collected from households which don’t have a use for it and is sold for 1 Nepalese Rupee per litre to farmers who use it to fertilise their crops.

In Siddhipur about 100 Ecosan toilets have been installed by various NGOs; most of these are of a type that allows for separation of urine from faecal matter. Therefore approximately 35000 litres of urine are available for use as plant fertiliser annually. Various studies found however that a large percentage of the source-separated urine was never used, but leached into the ground instead. For this there were various reasons, the most important of which is that a lot of people don’t have fields close to their house, so they cannot very easily use the urine. In a bid to increase the re-use of nutrients the STUN project was set up in a collaboration between UN-HABITAT and EAWAG from Switzerland (www.eawag.ch/stun). The aim of the project is to precipitate Struvite (a phosphorus fertiliser) from the urine and then either use the effluent in drip irrigation or treat it so that it can be leached without causing ground or surface water pollution.

<a href=""http://unhabitat.org.np/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ub-opening-17-may07-small.jpg""><img class=""alignleft wp-image-1647 "" src=""http://unhabitat.org.np/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ub-opening-17-may07-small-300x199.jpg"" alt=""ub-opening-17-may07-small"" width=""277"" height=""184"" /></a>The project found that though the precipitation process is simple and robust it could not be operated profitably if the urine has to be collected from many households. The main reason is that the process needs a magnesium source for the precipitation to happen, but currently there is no market for magnesium in Nepal and thus the price of the magnesium is too high locally. Further experiments with Struvite precipitation will be done at a school in Kathmandu where large amounts of urine are available in one spot.

During the project an increasing number of farmers in Siddhipur have started using urine as a fertiliser, because it yields good growth results while the crops require noticeably less chemical pesticides. As a result there is enough demand in the village for the urine and all of it will be used as long as it can be bought from a central point. In order to facilitate this a central collection tank has been installed, and a user committee has been established. For the collection the user committee employs one person equipped with a bicycle, and this collector is paid 50% of the revenue from the sales of the fertiliser. The remaining half is used to set up a maintenance fund.

As a result of the work of number of enthusiastic pioneering farmers and the effort of various NGOs, Siddhipur now sets an example of how to increase farm productivity and combat environmental degradation through a new view on human “waste”.

Speaking at the inaugural programme, Yogendra Chitrakar, Director of ECCA told that the water classroom was developed under 'Human Value-based Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Education (HVWSHE)' programme to enable students to understand the value of water from social, cultural, religious, economic, natural and scientific aspects.

According to him, HVWSHE is being implemented in 10 selected schools of Nepal for last two years to enhance awareness for HVWSE, build capacity to conduct HVWSE in the formal education sector, promote water and sanitation investments and implement HVWSHE in schools.

He added that the water classroom comprises the models of watershed and ground water recharge system,water cycle board, hydraulic water turbine and 3-Dimensional landscape of natural water supply system of Lalitpur. Similarly, the walls of the classroom are covered with creative arts and informative posters of water related activities. A musical instrument has also been developed using water bowls to demonstrate the use of water. A water library has also been set up in the same venue by collecting books and publications related to water and sanitation issues. Apart from it, a rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge system and a biosand filter has also been set up at the school premise. He also informed about another water classroom that is being established soon at Central Zoo. The visitors can collect information related to water from the computer placed in the classroom. The 'Water Hut', a model of watershed, has been constructed, from where the visitors can gain knowledge about the rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge technology. Mr. Chitrakar also shared some information about the activities and achievements of HVWSHE programme. He informed that HVWSHE programme had already oriented
different stakeholder particularly school teachers and government staffs on the importance and effectiveness of HVWSHE.

He told that the programme is preparing to integrate HVWSHE in existing school curriculum without burdening the objectives and contents of the curriculum in the selected schools, which inspire and motivate children by imparting knowledge on water, sanitation and hygiene and support in developing a new water use ethics in the society.",UN Habitat: One-stop venue to enhance knowledge on Water,publish,un-habitat-one-stop-venue-to-enhance-knowledge-on-water,9/8/2014 16:37
1707,8/25/2010 16:38,"An Inter-School Speech Competition has been organized on 2 August in Lalitpur to sensitize students on the importance of safe drinking water and enhance their knowledge on drinking water treatment options. The competition with the theme
“Drinking Water Treatment Options” has been organized jointly by Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO), UN HABITAT, EAWAG/SANDAC and Coca Cola Company.

The students participating from 4 different schools presented their speech about different drinking water Point of Use (PoU) options particularly chlorination, boiling, filtration and Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS) technique at the programme. Among them, four students
were selected as the winner in four different categories.Reshu Shrestha from Shree Shanti Secondary School was awarded in Bio-Sand Filter category, Pramod Sunuwar won the award in SODIS category where as award in Chlorination category went to Karishma Rawot and Colloidal Siver Filter category to Sangeeta Aalemagar of Kumbheshowr Primary School.The winners were felicitated with certificate and prize by the Senior Environment Journalist Bhairav Rishal, who believed that safe drinking water is essential for a healthy life. Since the quality of water available in Kathmnadu Valley is not reliable to drink without treatment, Rishal suggested every individual to treat
drinking water at their households.

Speaking about the environmental situation in Kathmandu Valley, he said that aquatic inhabitats of the river in the valley have disappeared completely due to river pollution. In his opinion, discharge of untreated wastewater into these water bodies is the major cause of this pollution. He said that it is occurring due to lack of public awareness on environmental sanitation.Executive Director of ENPHO Suman Shakya said that the child mortality rate due to various waterborne diseases has been decreased remarkably in Nepal due to successful efforts made by different WATSAN organizations in raising public awareness on safe drinking water and promoting drinking water PoU options.

ENPHO, UN HABITAT, EAWAG/SANDEC and Coca Cola Company has organized a week-long Water and Hygiene Campaign in 10 selected schools of Lalipur. The campaign has been initiated with the aim to sensitize students on safe drinking water, encourage them in its use and prevent waterborne diseases.

Apart from speech competition, the campaign conducted various activities including student orientation programmes, educational exposure visit and school cleaning campaigns.

In response to the campaign activities, Public Health Section officer of Lalitpur Sub-metropolitan City Karuna Bajracharya stated that the awareness raising activities on safe drinking water conducted in Lalipur have remarkably improved public health condition by controlling waterborne diseases in the municipal area. Lekhnath Panthi of Lalitpur District Public Health Office informed that incidence of waterborne diseases has been found reduced in Lalitpur due to promotion of PoU options. He urged all the students to convey the message of disinfecting drinking water at their homes and communities. Dibya Mani Gyawali, vice-principal at Shree Shanti Secondary School suggested all to disinfect drinking water at household level to end the use of unsafe drinking water.

UN HABITAT and Coca Cola Company has been conducting “Partnership for Safe Water” programme in Lalitpur Sub-metropolitan City for past few years. This campaign has been conducted in the same schools covered by the Partnership for Safe Water programme.The progrmame has also implemented its activities in other 5 municipalities of Nepal as well to extend safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities to urban poor.",UN-HABITAT promotes safe drinking water campaign among students,publish,un-habitat-promotes-safe-drinking-water-campaign-among-students,9/8/2014 17:18

Infrastructure Branch, UN HABITAT, Nairobi. Speaking at a dissemination workshop in Lalitpur on 21 July, Dzikus has shared this opinion. The workshop had been organized by UN HABITAT Water for Asian Cities Programmes to share the findings of the study carried out to evaluate the impact of WAC programme in urban WATSAN sector in Nepal. The programme has been receiving support from Water and Sanitation Trust Fund (WSTF) – managed by the Water, Sanitation and Infrastructure Branch (WSIB) under the Human Settlements Financing Division of UN-HABITAT. Based on the Nepal Country Impact Study report, Dzikus also mentioned about the tangible impacts that WAC programme did in last five years in urban WATSAN sector in Nepal. He believed that these achievements will help to increase the investment of donor countries and agencies in the country.

He stressed on the need to strategize the community involvement approaches to optimize the impacts of available WSTF. He appreciated WAC partners for their praiseworthy contribution in gender and poverty mapping, which has been appreciated and brought in use by the key ministries in Nepal.

Krishna Prasad Acharya, joint secretary, Ministry of Physical Planning and Works expressed his commitment to take initiative to replicate the successful WATSAN practices in new urban areas of Nepal. He said that WATSAN organizations have done an appreciable job in urban WATSAN sector, which has increase coverage of safe drinking water and improved sanitation in urban areas.

At the programme, Dr. Roshan Raj Shrestha, UN HABITAT Regional Chief Technical Advisor, South Asia stressed that the urban water and sanitation should be given compatible priority along with other development sectors to achieve remarkable improvement in WATSAN in urban areas.

According to him, the UN-HABITAT has been running various WATSAN projects under its WAC Programme in 35 municipalities, 18 small towns and 8 peri-urban area of Nepal. These projects have conducted various WATSAN activities with focus on pro-poor WATSAN governance, urban water demand management, integrated urban environmental sanitation, and income generation for the urban poor. He informed that the programme has directly benefited more than 232 thousand people improving their living standards with
remarkable improvement in water supply and sanitation in the programme areas.

Sharing about the partnership between the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) and UNHABITAT in building the capacity of local agencies and communities in small towns of Nepal, Gajendra Thakur,Director General, DWSS suggested UN-HABITAT to allocate their support in hardware components of the project so that WATSAN services could improved and made easily accessible to urban poor.

Dr. Mahendra Subba, Deputy Director General, Department of Urban Development and Building Construction informed that the department has completed poverty mapping in 10 municipalities with support of UN-HABITAT. He urged the development organizations to design their development plans based on these poverty maps to benefit poor and marginalized groups dwelling in these municipalities. He also informed that the department has allocated separate budget to continue poverty mapping in other municipalities, too.",Nepal: the best achiever among UN HABITAT Supported Countries,publish,nepal-the-best-achiever-among-un-habitat-supported-countries,9/8/2014 17:25

Nepal launched the Bagmati Action Plan officially amid a function organized by High Powered Committee for the Integrated Development of Bagmati Civilization (HPCIDBC) and National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC) in the Capital.

Since the Bagmati River is linked to Bagmati Civilization,natural beauty and urban development; it should beprotected in natural condition- said Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal. He believed that the BAP will be very helpful in materializing the efforts made to conserve Bagmati River system. He urged all the stakeholders to help in maintaining the historical, cultural and environmental importance of the river.

The Plan had been prepared by HPCIDBC, NTNC with technical and financial support of UN-HABITAT Water for Asian Cities Programme Nepal and United Nation Environment Programme (UNEP). It had been ratified as the official framework document for the development of
river system of Kathmandu Valley from the Ministerial Cabinet of Government of Nepal on 11 August, 2009.Dr. Siddhartha B. Bajracharya, Executive Officer, NTNC claimed that it is the first plan of its kind in Nepal, which was brought to conserve river system. He told that it is a
five year project that aims to clean the Bagmati river system and its tributaries. According to him, an estimated budget of NRs. 15 billion has been proposed for the successful implementation of this action plan.The Plan has identified decreasing water flow,degradation of river water quality, degradation of catchment quality, narrowing and deepening of water way and depletion of aquatic diversity as the major problems in Bagmati River system. Similarly, it has identified the discharging of untreated sewerage,dumping of waste along the river bank, sand mining and river bank encroachment as the main cause behind Bagmati River pollution.

Hence, the Bagmati Action Plan has classified the valley into five different zones- Natural Conservation Core Zone, Rural Zone, Peri-urban Zone, Urban Zone and Downstream Zone, in order to address the issues of river pollution at micro level. It has proposed different activities for different zones to address these problems at micro level, said Mr. Ram Chandra Devkota, Member Secretary of HPCIDBC while presenting the implementation strategy of BAP at the launching programme.

The Plan has proposed for afforestation and rainwater harvesting at Shivapuri Watershed and other areas to increase water quality and flow in the river. It has given top priority to onsite sanitation including technologies such as ECOSAN toilet to improve environmental sanitation and reduce river pollution at Natural Conservation Core Zone and Urban Zone.In addition, the plan has also proposed for rehabilitation
of the existing wastewater treatment plants and the promotion of Decentralized Wastewater Treatment System (DEWATS). It has also planned to adopt public private partnership approach for the faecal sludge management in some areas as well.

Apart from it, the plan has also recommended for establishing short and long-term sanitation landfill sites for waste management. It will promote household and community level waste management system, and engage private sector for the management of solid waste in Kathmandu Valley.",Prime Minister launches the Bagmati Action Plan,publish,prime-minister-launches-the-bagmati-action-plan,9/8/2014 17:32

Sanitation Fund (GSF) Programme, which will be invested solely in sanitation sector in the country.The programme aimed to provide support to the Government of Nepal to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and National targets on sanitation.

There were around 100 participants at the launching programme particularly from different government ministries, department and agencies, UN Agencies including UN Habitat, Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC) and other donor organizations, International and National Non-Government Organizations, Civil Society Organizationsand different media. They were introduced to GSF
Programme and its objectives, and consulted to makethe programme more effective.

Addressing the launching programme, Joint Secretary at Ministry of Physical Planning and Works, andchairperson of NCB, Raj Kumar Malla stated that the GSF Programme has appeared as an opportunity in Nepal, which will accelerate the ongoing sanitation activities in the country. According to him, it will be allocated to develop Open Defecation Free communities,strengthen stakeholders, support implementation of National Hygiene and Sanitation Master Plan, knowledge management and disseminate learning.

Chief, Water and Sanitation Section II, Water, Sanitation and Infrastructure Branch, UN HABITAT, Andre Dzikussaid that the GSF programme would play pivotal role in drawing the attention of the Nepal Government and various other donor organizations to sanitation. He was very hopeful that the programme would bring behavioural change and increase access to sustainable, safe sanitation and hygiene that would result better health in the targeted communities.

GSF Programme Manager at WSSCC Barry Jackson told that the GSF programme has been expected to establish Open Defecation Free communities by the end of the project. He also informed that the programme can be extended if found effective from mid-term evaluation.
Dr. Roshan Raj Shrestha, Regional Chief Technical Advisor, UN Habitat South Asia expressed that GSF programme would act as a catalyzing agency for resource pooling arrangements in Nepal. In his opinion,the fund will help to fulfill the resource gaps in sanitation sector.

Briefing about the GSF Programme, Oliver Jones,Programme Officer at WSSCC informed that the five year programme has aimed to strengthen the civil society groups, schools, private sectors in Nepal. He added that it would conduct various activities keeping poor and un-served community in the centre in order to promote hygiene, raise awareness and create demand for sanitation. It has also planned to maintain integration and linkages among different local resources of the targeted areas.

After this launching, Nepal has become the first country to initiate GSF programme in Asia. The programme has already launched similar projects in Madagascar and Senegal.

GSF is the world's only multi-donor fund created by WSSCC to help more people attain safe sanitation and practice good hygiene. It has appointed UN Habitat, through a open competition process, as its Executing Agency in Nepal. This appointment has been made to distribute the fund to different sanitation and hygiene programmes in the country.

Trust for Nature Conservation,Guthi, and Environment and Public Health Organization has developed a tele-serial “Dhalamati” with
support of UN Habitat to sensitize people on faecal sludge management and promote septic tank at household level.The tele-serial, directed by MaHa

Sanchar, was premiered in Lalipur on 26 November, 2010 amid a programme organized to mark the World Hand Washing Day 2010 and the World Toilet Day 2010 in Nepal. The Premier Show was inaugurated by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Planning and
Works Mr. Bijay Kumar Gachhadar, who told that the tele-serial would be very successful to motivate people to contribute in reducing river pollution by constructing septic tanks. He added that the serial had also highlighted the significance of wastewater treatment plant for sewage management in urban areas.

Dr. Roshan Raj Shrestha, Chief Technical Advisor of UN Habitat South Asia Region believed that the construction of septic tank would help to reduce the trend of discharging untreated sewage in the river, which would improve river water quality and, in turn, urban environment. He suggested the local government authorities to associate with private sectors for the construction of wastewater treatment plant. In his opinion, it would increase job opportunities in addition to managing sewage and improving river environment.Speaking about the Dhalamati, renowned artist Madan Krishna Shrestha told that toilet construction is not getting priority due to lack of public awareness on sanitation. In such condition, Dhalamati would be effective to sensitize people on the importance of septic tank and sewage management, he said. He also urged all urban dwellers to take initiative in an individual level for cleaning the rivers.

After the Premier Show, the teleserial has been telecasted through a national level television channel for the broader dissemination of the
messages about septic tank and sewage management.

The Dhalamti showing its concerns towards river pollution and its impact on environmental sanitation and public health has attempted to
raise public awareness on sewage management and significance of the use of septic tank. Meanwhile, it has also presented the technical
aspects that one should consider at the time of construction of septic tank.

In the serial, renowned artist Hari Bamsha Acharya has performed the role of Hari Prasad, a tenant deprived of toilet facility. Similarly, Madan Krishna Shrestha played the role of house owner, who never willed to discharge sewage in the river and always wished to keep river clean.

The tele-serial moves around the problems confronted by Hari Prasad and his family for not having a toilet. Dhalamati, in addition to entertaining the audiences, also advocates for proper sewage management, which is being directly discharged into the river affecting river ecosystem adversely. The serial has also suggested the concerned government bodies to construct modern wastewater treatment plants to manage the toilet waste generated from the Kathmandu Valley",‘Dhalamati’ sensitizing people on Sewage management,publish,dhalamati-sensitizing-people-on-sewage-management,9/8/2014 17:58

In this context UN-HABITAT and Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) jointly organized a consultative workshop on 1st November, 2010 in Lalitpur to disseminate the findings of the
""Nepal Urban Housing Sector Profile Study"". The study was carried out by UN-HABITAT in association with Centre for Integrated Urban Development (CIUD) to support the government shelter policy.

Inaugurating the workshop, Dr. Dinesh Chandra Devkota, member of NPC, praised that the study has provided the latest meaningful and
scientific data on urban housing sector of Nepal. Speaking about the national shelter policy of the government, Mr. Deep Basnyat, secretary at MPPW shared that the Government of Nepal (GoN) has recently taken several initiatives in housing sector including policy review and investment increment to improve housing sector, 'people's housing' being one of them. Joint Secretary at MPPW Mr. Suresh Prakash Acharya stressed on the essence of land utilization policy in Nepal. Since Nepal is more vulnerable to natural disasters, the government is trying its best to enforce the standard guidelines on housing while constructing infrastructures, he said.

Mr. Christopher Lalande, representative from head quarter and Ms. Lowie Rosales, Human Settlement Officer from the regional office, UN-HABITAT commended the willingness of the government towards investing in housing sector and committed their support in the process. Mr. Padma Sunder Joshi, Habitat Programme Manager of UN-HABITAT in Nepal told that housing sector in Nepal can be improved by making housing investments more accessible to urban poor communities. He informed that the study has unfolded several urban housing
issues and provided comprehensive recommendations in the report. The report reveals that the investment on housing sector in the cities has increased artificially in the last few years due to speculation and absence of secured alternative sector to invest. It has been reported that the land price in urban areas has increased by three-folds in last seven years, whereas the land purchasing rate increased by two times in 2008/09. However, the situation did not prove to be positive in the case of urban poor.

Therefore, the study recommends for strengthening financing institutions and adopting subsidy provision in housing loan schemes to increase access of urban poor to different financing programmes brought to manage and expand housing facilities in cities. According to it, strategic intervention is required to control land market for the benefit of the poor. The report has underlined the importance of supporting housing for low income groups. It has stressed that the government should work beyond facilitator.

As a part of this intervention, Open Defecation Free (ODF) communities are one of the achievements among many other results envisioned.

Surajpur is among one the poorest community of Guleriya Municipality with 75 households (2010). People in the community are migrated from near by hill districts like Dailekh, Jajarkot and Rukum due to natural disasters. Main occupation of the people is to collect firewood from nearby forest of India and selling in Gulariya bazzar.

Surajpur Tole Lane Organization (TLO) becomes first community to declare as an open defecation free (ODF) community out of 231 TLOs in entire Gulariya Municipality.

Before the implementation of SWASHTHA project in 2009, almost all household of the community defecate openly in the bank of nearby Sarju River, fields, roads and forest. Only two households out of 75 have pit latrine. “We could see human feaces every where in the roads and could see people defecating in the fields while going to work in the fields”, recalls Mr. Khamba Prasad Gharti, the situation of the community just one and half year back. Mr. Gharti is a resident of Surajpur and Treasurer of the TLO. Mr. Gharti also shared the situation when a guest comes to the community “If the guest’s habit is also to defecate openly, then there is no problem but if not, we felt so embarrassed to tell them going out for toilet”.

Community’s first demand was “One House One toilet” when SWASHTHA project started collecting demand. Initially, the project oriented and trained the people on better sanitation including personal, household and environment sanitation using various IPRA (Ignition Participatory Rural Appraisal) tools. After making the people aware on need and importance of toilet, Project Management Committee (PMC) comprising of community representative, project staffs and Gulariya Municipality decided to support in building toilets. The project supported construction materials equivalent to NRs. 2500 and community people shared the insufficient amount to build their toilets. Majority of people invested small amount ranging from NRs. 750 to NRs. 1000 on top of project support and build the superstructures from locally available materials like bamboo, Khar (grass) and wood. Some has built toilets with bricks and metal roofing investing more than NRs. 10000.

Now, all 75 household has individual water seal toilet in Surajpur. The construction of toilets was done in three stages building 25 toilets in each stage. The users committee faced no problems in the first stage; however in second and third stage users committee faced a hard time to trigger people to build toilets. As triggering tools, users committee even applied social pressure like fining for open defecators and boycotting from TLO.

“This summer only two incidence of diarrhea is found in the community whereas it was a common problem before. Awareness level of community on sanitation has increased significantly. Roads and neighboring environment are cleaner and we don’t need to hide in a bush for toilet”. Mr. Gharti compares the situation of the community. Similar communities and Officials from Tikapur and Bharatpur Municipality also visited Surajpur to listen the success story which will further inspire the community to maintain ODF declaration in future. Surajpur TLO is also thinking to build a community urinal for passerby as hundreds of people travel to India via Surajpur.

Lalitpur Sub-metropolitan City (LSMC), the nearest city of the capital of Nepal- Kathmandu, is one of the developed cities of Nepal, where majority of denizens have more or less access to most of the basic services. But, people are still deprived from basic water and sanitation services.

There are many water sources such as city supply, stone spouts, dug wells and others, but water from these sources are neither sufficient to meet the demand of growing population nor safe to drink. By virtue of it, incidences of cholera and other diarrheal diseases appear every year with commence of monsoon in Lalitpur.

Considering it, LSMC, Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) and Urban Environment Management Society (UEMS) jointly launched a project in selected poor urban and peri-urban cluster of the city to promote Point of Use (PoU) drinking water, and increase access of urban poor to safe drinking water.

It conducted various awareness raising activities, and promoted household water treatment options including boiling, chlorination, filtration and Solar Water Disinfection Techniques (SODIS) widely to bring behavioral change in city dwellers and materialize the vision that the project had made at the time of its beginning in Lalitpur.

The stakeholder consultation meetings were held to discuss about the implementation of programme activities. It organized trainings and produced more than 80 community trainers to orient people about the importance of safe drinking water as well as to promote PoU options. It also organized about 70 community orientation programmes on safe drinking water and PoU Options following these training.

In addition, students and teachers were sensitized on the importance of safe drinking water, introduced them to PoU options, and increased knowledge on health and hygiene by organizing educational events on water, health and hygiene at 25 different schools of Lalitpur. Household water treatment options were also installed at 11 schools in the area. The colloidal silver filters were provided to 22 health clinics in Lalitpur.

Likewise, information on safe drinking water and PoU options were disseminated through FM radios and by performing street dramas, too.

These efforts have finally contributed to achieve the targets that the programme had envisioned. Four communities in Lalitpur (Chochehen, Chhusika, Lohanla and Kwenani of Lalitpur) have already declared their communities as ""Safe Water Zone."" People in these communities were using untreated and unsafe drinking water due to the lack of awareness; and cholera and diarrheoal diseases were considered as common phenomena.

After intervention of the project activities, they realized the importance of safe drinking water. None of the households in these communities drinks untreated and unsafe water in these days. Every household uses PoU options at their home to disinfect drinking water. It has reduced incidences of waterborne diseases in their communities.

The initiatives undertaken by these communities have become a good example for others community people as well. It has increased the use of PoU options in other communities of Lalitpur. Many other communities are also practicing the water treatment options so that they could also declare their communities as safe water zone. It has also helped to decrease incidences of waterborne diseases in the municipal area in the year 2009.","“Partnership for Safe Water” Programme in Lalitpur: Four Communities declared ""Safe Water Zone""",publish,partnership-for-safe-water-programme-in-lalitpur-four-communities-declared-safe-water-zone,9/9/2014 14:42

Apart from these, these schools sensitized students on various WATSAN issues, who later conducted different awareness raising campaigns including street drama, essay competition, cleaning campaigns and other awareness activities that disseminated the message about safe drinking water and proper sanitation in the area effectively.

At the programme, the sport materials were also distributed to 14 schools of the district with support of the International Olympic Committee.

Handing over the sport materials, Mr. Thapa told that the distribution of those materials aims to impart extra curricular knowledge to the
school students and help them in developing their personality. Chief Technical Advisor at South Asia Region, UN Habitat Water for Asian Cities Programme Dr. Roshan Raj Shrestha appreciated the role played by concerned government agencies and civil society organizations to achieve remarkable improvement in implementing human value based water, sanitation and hygiene education in the last few years in
Nepal. He opined that such activities should be continued further to improve water and sanitation sector in the country. During the felicitation programme, the students drew and exhibited the pictures about the value of safe and adequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in human life.

Regarding these pictures, Prafulla Man Singh Pradhan, UN Habitat informed that UN Habitat would select some among these pictures to send in an international art competition that would be organized by UN Habitat to commemorate World Habitat Day 2011.

Curriculum Officer at Curriculum Development Center (CDC), Ram Prasad Subedi said that piloting of human value based water,sanitation and hygiene education programmes at school curriculums would help the CDC to improve its school level curriculum in days ahead.

Rashmi Kafle, president of Stepping Stone said that similar projects have also been implemented at more than 40 schools of Morang,
Sunsari, Bharatpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur as well. She also shared that the sport materials have also been provided to those schools.
At the programme, the team of students from Padma Prakash S.School performed a drama bearing the information about importance of safe drinking water and sanitation.",Schools honored for praiseworthy contribution in WATSAN sector,publish,schools-honored-for-praiseworthy-contribution-in-watsan-sector,9/9/2014 15:05

The Practical Action Nepal (PAN),Environment and Public Health Organisation (ENPHO) and Municipal Association of Nepal (MuAN) with support of UN Habitat Water for Asian Cities (WAC) Programme is implementing this project in urban and peri urban settlements of Bharatpur, Butwal,Gularia and Tikapur municipalities to improve the health and well being of poor residents. These WAC partners cooperate with respective municipalities and concerned Village Development Committees (VDCs) for the effective implementation of the
project. The project is also receiving support from the European Union and ISLE of Man Government.

After this declaration, Sitapur has become the first community in Tikapur to declare ODF in the Municipality. There are 106 households (HHs) in the community, where 84 per cent HHs were practicing open defecation before the project intervention. The community people with support of the project constructed 89 individual toilets that helped them to bring their community to this stage.

Likewise, the project established Dipendranagar and Kothiya as the second and third community to declare ODF in Gulariya Municipality. With the construction of 17 toilets in Dipendranagar and 113 toilets in Kothiya, both communities declared ODF in February 2011.

In addition, the project also adopted an integrated approach in order to improve environmental health condition of urban poor communities, which firstly focused jointly on low cost household option on water treatment, sanitation,indoor air pollution and hygiene.

To improve sanitation, it is promoting low cost improved pit latrine, ECOSAN (Ecological Sanitation) and bio gas. Most of the constructions were done using the local materials and local labours to create a sense of ownership and support the local livelihoods.

To demonstrate the low cost toilets and to change the mindset of those people who thinks toilet construction is expensive, the project used bamboo structures,mud walls and jute bags for superstructures of toilet.

It promoted hygiene education like practices of proper hand washing,safe storage of water, waste management, kitchen management and grey water management for further better health outcomes.

This year WWD 2011 had been dedicated to the theme ""Water and Urbanization"", with slogan ""Water for Cities: Responding to the Urban Challenges"".

The Nepal National Water Week Organizing Committee (NNWWOC), chaired by Water and Energy Commission Secretariat, Government of Nepal (WECS/GoN), coordinated several activities during a week long programme. UN Habitat associated with NNWWOC as an active coalition organization to participate in NWW- 2011 and provided support in different events held to celebrate NWW.

The WECS, Centre of Research for Environment Energy and Water, and the Small Earth Nepal organized the ""Second National Symposium on Challenges and Opportunities for Sustainable Management of Groundwater Resources of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal"" was organized in Kathmandu on 22 March, 2011. The symposium aimed at sharing the knowledge on quantitative and qualitative management of groundwater use in the Kathmandu Valley along with its legislative issues. In addition, the programme had also been expected to identify remedial measures to improve quality of groundwater in the valley, and raise awareness on significance of groundwater and its current status in the Kathmandu Valley among stakeholders, sector player and high level policy-makers.

As an associate partner of organizing committee, UN Habitat participated at the symposium and Padma Sundar Joshi, Habitat Programme Manager, UN Habitat shared about the challenges of urban water management in Kathmandu Valley at the programme. He believed that urban dwellers including denizen of Kathmandu are compel to dig deeper and exploit fossil water due to acute water shortage in cities. Therefore, he stressed on urgent need for a national dialogue on urban water management.

At the programme, experts discussed on community based water management and its challenges, river pollution rainwater recharge, ownership and groundwater issues, drinking water quality, wastewater treatment, and groundwater management in Asia-Pacific.

Meanwhile, a sharing workshop was also held in Lalitpur to share about different aspects of rain water harvesting and discuss on challenges related to water supply in urban areas. The workshop had been coordinated by the Society of Public Health Engineers, Nepal (SOPHEN) with support of Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS), UN Habitat and World Health Organization (WHO) and Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board (RWSSFB).

The workshop recommended for rainwater harvesting for drinking as well as ground water recharging purpose. It also suggested the policy makers to address the issues related to water sources and its ownership. The experts also urged the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL) for improving its management and reviewing the water tariff.

Amid the sharing workshop, a journal of water, sanitation, health and environment was also released.

UN Habitat also celebrated WWD- 2011 in WAC Project areas outside Kathmandu Valley. The Sukekhola Community of Kamalamai Municipality was declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) on this occasion.

The community had been declared ODF amid a function organized by the Sukekhola Environment Improvement Committee and the New Star Child Club.

Earlier, only 12 out of 88 households in Sukekhola had toilet facility. Locals used to practice open defecation owing to lack of toilets in their houses.

In 2009 AD, the Sukekhola Environment Improvement Committee and the Centre for Integrated Urban Development with support of UN Habitat and Water Aid Nepal initiated water and sanitation improvement activities in Sukekhola under Kamalamai Integrated Water, Sanitation and Hygiene programme.

The programme supported the villagers to construct toilet in the remaining 66 households. It also conducted various water and sanitation activities in the community to enhance their knowledge on health and hygiene, which in turn helped villagers to declare their community ODF. After this declaration, Sukekhola has become the first ODF community in Kamalamai Municipality.",UN Habitat celebrated World Water Day 2011 in Nepal,publish,un-habitat-celebrated-world-water-day-2011-in-nepal,9/9/2014 16:18

Centre for Integrated Urban Development (CIUD) in close coordination with local sector stakeholders, District water supply and sanitation office, District public health office and local Water and Sanitation Users Committees with support of WaterAid in Nepal (WAN) and UN Habitat Water for Asian Cities (WAC) Programme is implementing this project in peri urban settlements of Kamalamai municipality to improve the water, sanitation and health condition of poor and vulnerable residents. These WAC partners cooperate with respective municipality for the effective implementation of the project.

After this declaration, Sukekhola has become the first community in Kamalamai to declare ODF in the Municipality. There are 88 households (HHs) in the community, where 75 per cent HHs were practicing open defecation before the project intervention. The community people with support of the project constructed 66 individual toilets that helped them to bring their community to this stage.

In addition, the project also adopted an integrated approach in order to improve environmental health condition of urban poor communities, which firstly focused jointly on low cost household option on water treatment, sanitation, and hygiene. Since it needs huge investment to improve the quality of water at source, this project has opted to promote the Point of use (PoU) treatment methodology to safeguard the health of the community people. Community people awareness level has been enhanced through the trained water quality volunteers who are responsible to test the quality of water in the community and disseminate the result to the wider audience.

To improve sanitation, it is promoting low cost improved double pit latrine and bio gas. Most of the constructions were done using the local materials and local labours to create a sense of ownership and support the local livelihoods.

To supplement the local ownership local masons were trained and hired to execute the job and has supported in income generation. Equity and inclusion has been the centre point during project intervention. Women representation in Water and sanitation users committee is overwhelming and has triggered the huge community participation in project activities. Disable and child friendly toilet has been promoted.

To demonstrate the low cost toilets and to change the mindset of those people who thinks toilet construction is expensive, the project used bamboo structures, cement concrete block and jute bags for superstructures of toilet.

This project has trained ward wise FCHVs and interested local women volunteers and developed them as V-WASH (Volunteers for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) and has promoted hygiene education like practices of proper hand washing, safe storage of water, waste management, kitchen management and grey water management for further better health outcomes through Door to Door campaign and to bring about the behavioral change in the community. Likewise it has trained Child Clubs and School children to safe guard the WASH activities basically focusing on sustaining the ODF status and to aware the communities on WASH issues.

The project is currently working closely with local authorities, Community Based Organization (CBOs), schools and Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) to further improve sustainability and integration, and deliver project activities effectively.

Community based monitoring and evaluation (CBME) tool has been introduced for maintaining the transparency in financial aspect and raising ownership within community people for the sustainability of project intervention.

Likewise Rapid Convenient Survey (RCS), a hygiene monitoring tool has been introduced and practiced to access the behavioral changes brought by the hygiene related intervention.

In addition, the project has envisaged widening its activities in upper part of Kamalamai municipality focusing its activities on poorly maintained sanitation problems of small town which has been overshadowed due to the huge investment in water sector and lack of community awareness on the importance of sanitation facilities.","Sukekhola, the first community in Kamalamai Municipality declared open defecation free in Water for Asian Cities Projects",publish,sukekhola-the-first-community-in-kamalamai-municipality-declared-open-defecation-free-in-water-for-asian-cities-projects,9/9/2014 18:19

This is a major cause for the spread of water-borne diseases,which results in the death of about 10,500 children under the age of five each year. The Government of
Nepal has set a target of 100 % water and sanitation coverage by 2017, and it is working with various other organizations to meet this
target. One such initiative is the Global Sanitation Fund (GSF) programme in Nepal, which was launched in October 2010 and is now moving ahead in full swing.GSF programme in Nepal will reach 5 districts, one from each Development Region of Nepal and will also cover the three ecological regions viz; Mountains, Hills and Plains. GSF has targeted 225 VDCs and 4 Municipalities from these 5 districts including an  additional municipality from Kailali District. During a meeting of the National Coordinating Body (NCB) for GSF in Nepal in early January,
the five focus districts were selected based on set criteria. The districts selected are Bajura,Bardiya, Arghakhanchi,Sindhupalchock and Sunsari. Similarly the municipalities which the GSF will work in are Dharan,Gulariya, Inaruwa, Itahari and Tikapur. In addition, the GSF also aims to support to the three sanitation model districts viz.Chitwan, Kaski and Tanahun that are driving to achieve total sanitation coverage.

The GSF Programme aims to stimulate community action for achieving open defecation free status through demand driven approach, develop capacity of stakeholders at all levels,strengthen national sanitation sector strategies and record and use lessons learned to support the scaling up in other districts focusing on strategies for accelerating progress towards the national and MDG sanitation targets.In order to achieve the objectives,GSF will be working closely with local partners, including central and local government bodies, Subgrantees and sector stakeholders.GSF has already shortlisted 27 potential Sub-grantees through call for expression of interest. Request for proposals (RFPs) have been issued for 11 sub-grants under the different components for Bajura and Bardiya Districts and Tikapur and Gulariya Municipalities for the first funding round. A two-day orientation workshop (20-21 April 2011) was recently organized prior to proposal submission for the shortlisted Sub-grantees in Kathmandu with an objective to provide basic understanding on GSF and sanitation sector activities and to clarify more on the pertinent issues. NCB members, Country Programme Monitor (CPM) and other concerned stakeholders including donors were also invited on the occasion in order to strengthen sector collaboration and coordination.

<p style=""color: #444444;"">Every year on the first Monday of October we reflect on the state of our human settlements and what we want the cities of our future to look like. This year, the United Nations has chosen to turn the spotlight on the people who live or have lived in informal settlements, listening to “Voices from Slums”.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444;"">The goal is to raise awareness of life conditions in some areas of the planet which are crowded, with inadequate housing, poor or no water and sanitation facilities and no security of tenure. There is rarely any public space in these areas and no allocation for streets, meaning no public transport and no access for emergency services.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444;"">As part of the Millennium Development Goals, the world pledged to improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers by the year 2020. By 2010 we had achieved this by more than 2 fold. However, with growing urbanisation, the number of people being born in or moving into these areas is also increasing and the overall number of people living in slums continues to rise. Estimates claim that there are already one billion people living in slums.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444;"">People in slums are also disproportionately affected by climate change, with houses often built precariously on slopes or unsuitable building space and with inadequate materials making them vulnerable to landslides, floods and earthquakes.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444;"">Great efforts are being made to improve many slums around the world and better the lives of those that live there. But slums are a manifestation of rapid unchecked urbanisation – a result of allowing our cities to expand without design or regulation and with disregard to their citizens. While continuing to upgrade the slums we have, we urgently need to focus our efforts on robust urban planning and the provision of safe, affordable housing that is appropriate and adequate for our citizens’ growing needs.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444;"">Through real stories it is possible to demonstrate to decision makers in the urban arena that slum upgrading programmes can achieve better life conditions for slum dwellers, and greater economic and social impacts.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444;"">In 2016, the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development – Habitat III will set us on the path for a new urban agenda. But we cannot wait until then to stop the spread of slums. Our urban citizens have the right to adequate housing and basic services and we need to make sure that our cities and towns are planned appropriately to provide these.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444;"">Nearly one billion urban slum dwellers are counting on it. We should hear their voices.</p>

<p style=""color: #444444;"">Over the past decade, efforts under the Millennium Development Goals have cut the proportion of people living in slums by more than half.  Yet, over the same period, rapid urbanization, especially in the developing world, has seen overall slum populations rise.  In some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, as many as 70 per cent of urban dwellers live in slums and informal settlements.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444;"">Slums are often located on the least desirable and appropriate land, such as flood plains and steep hillsides, and are inherently vulnerable to the increasingly severe weather events that climate change is causing.  Many of the people who inhabit slums were pushed to migrate by the lack of opportunities in rural areas or their countries of origin.  They regularly lack basic services such as water, sanitation, electricity and street lighting.  Crime is often endemic, with women and girls particularly at risk.  Unemployment, underemployment and the cost of transport to distant places of work add further hardship.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444;"">To achieve sustainable development and a life of dignity for all, we must address these issues.  This year, World Habitat Day is devoted to giving a voice to slum dwellers.  Often, people in the slums live in near-anonymity — no address, no census and no idea when their living conditions will improve.  By learning from their experiences, city planners and policymakers can enhance the well-being of a significant portion of the human family.  Let us hear from people who live in slums what has worked and what has not — and what we need to do.</p>
<p style=""color: #444444;"">On this World Habitat Day, I encourage Governments, businesses, academic institutions and non-governmental organizations to give slum dwellers a voice — and to listen to what they have to say.  We have the technology and the know-how to build economically, socially and environmentally sustainable cities based on local solutions.  Ensuring that our towns and cities expand in a well-planned and managed way is not only necessary to meeting the housing needs of our growing urban population, it is also vital for combating climate change, protecting the environment and supporting sustainable development.  Let us focus on a new urban agenda that leaves no one behind.</p>","‘Give Slum Dwellers a Voice’, Secretary-General says in Message for World Habitat Day",publish,give-slum-dwellers-a-voice-secretary-general-says-in-message-for-world-habitat-day,10/7/2014 12:43

Organising a press meet, DUDBC today informed that it will organise a national level seminar on October 13, in collaboration with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), Lumanti Support Group for Shelter and the Society of Women’s Unity Nepal. Besides, subordinate offices of the DUDBC and various other organisations will also be conducting different programmes throughout the country.

The theme for World Habitat Day 2014 is ‘Voices from Slums’ which aims to acknowledge life’s hardships in slums, by giving an opportunity to slum dwellers to voice and air their experiences, knowledge and ideas about improving their living conditions. The theme also aims to highlight the efforts made to achieve Millennium Development Goals.

In Nepal’s context, the day aims to raise information and public awareness about challenges such as growing urbanisation, expansion and construction of new cities without basic urban infrastructure and services, disorganised, rampant and harmful settlement as well as settlements vulnerable to natural disaster, environmental pollution, encroachment in public and green places, and increase in private vehicles for transportation, informed DUDBC.

According to DUDBC, urban population is increasing by 6.65 per cent compared to national average of 2.27 per cent in Nepal. The urban population accounts for about 17 per cent of total population while the Kathmandu Valley alone shares 54.4 per cent of urban population. Likewise, about 23 per cent of the urban population in the country is under poverty line.

<em>Well-to-do people need to realize that slum dwellers also have rights to basic facilities, including right to survive in city</em>
<strong>
</strong>What bothers Bindu Poudel the most nowadays is that the apartments are being constructed in front of her resident at Ekaltar of Ichangu Narayan VDC in Kathmandu. As the construction work is entering the final phase, Poudel along with more of her neighbors are just not in position of wait and see but ready to hit the streets. Only reason for people´s anger here is the government´s plan to relocate squatters to their posh locality.

Ekaltar, where the Department of Urban Development and Building Code (DUDBC) has been constructing seven apartments in a bid to ensure settlement for the landless, teems with seemingly well-to-do folk.

Many of the residents of the neighborhood have majestic houses built on sprawling plots of land with the boundary wall tall enough to restrict outsiders from even viewing them. A four wheeler or two parked on the premises is a common sight throughout the new locality established in the planned neighborhood.

It´s not that the seven apartments being built by the state for the landless is that bad. Each apartment has the capacity to house 233 families where each family have three room flat comprising a bedroom, drawing room and kitchen with attached toilet bathroom.

But the neighbors around are not ready to accept their presence.

""Relocation of squatters will violate peace and tranquility of our locality,"" says Poudel disdainfully.

Gopal Bahadur Bhandari who leads the Tole Sudhar Samiti (neighborhood improvement committee) of Ekaltar is “worried” that the children of the neighborhood will “lose their track” if they get fall into the company of squatters´ children.

Given the situation, the noble residents of the locality have already organized themselves to resist the government´s plan to settle squatters there.

Back in downtown Kathmandu, at the Thapathali-based UN Park, the landless evicted from the banks of the Bagmati River are languishing.

“Hard-hit by the monsoon, we are now struggling to brace for the winter,” says 42 years old Kamala Tamang, squatting outside her makeshift tent where she and her family have been living ever since the government demolished her house by the Bagmati banks in 2012.

The numerous questions posed by her children unanswered -- due to poverty. Two square meals a day, continuation of school for the children, treatment to ailing family members and a trustworthy commitment from the responsible authority are some of the major challenge.

""There was a hope last year that the second Constituent Assembly elections would bring our plights to the attention of our leaders and would increase our negotiating power,"" said Tamang.

""We have finally realized that there is nobody who cares for us,"" says Suman Chaudhari, leader of the Squatters´ Struggle Committee.

<strong>The ray of hope</strong>

But they see a ray of hope in the forms of a few social organizations which have come forward to help them, though DUDBC also has been trying to help them of late.

Lumanti, an organization that advocates for the livelihood of landless and the urban poor, has been constructing the affordable apartments targeting the squatters and urban poor in 10 municipalities across the country.

“As many as 5,000 houses have been constructed under the public private partnership,” says Lumanti´s Communication Officer Shama Bajra.
Has the organization faced similar hurdles like the one the DUDBC is facing at Ekaltar?

""Creating a new settlement is impossible job until or unless we clear misconceptions about the new people to resettle there,"" says Bajra. “Both the new settlers and the old habitants have to share water and drainage facility. Thus, it will be an injustice to both the groups if we don´t clear the confusion.”

""Lumanti conducts a series of interactions between the stakeholders without which beginning the housing project is impossible,"" she added.

As per the two-year plan of the DUDBC, the seven apartments at Ekaltar will completed at an estimated cost of Rs 140 million in two phases, with the first phase to be concluded by April and the second by September next year.

However, the flat is not free of cost. The office would determine the rent once the construction work is accomplished. Similarly, the authority would require the tenants to renew the contract after 10 years.

But there are other problems, too.

The squatters at Thapathali say that they would not move to the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley.

Squatters´ leader Chaudhary argues that most of the people who live in the settlement are daily wage earners and they would not go to live in the apartments paying rent.

""The government can´t guarantee us job in and around the new locality, and we can´t travel every day using public transport in search of work in the city,"" he explains.

While around 16,000 squatters are estimated to be living at public land encroaching upon various riverbanks of the Valley, Chaudhary is annoyed for being targeted only as squatters.

""We are aliens for rest of the city dwellers, that is why the government remains quiet when we face accusations of being a menace to the society,"" he charges.

<strong>Put yourself in the shoes of the slum dwellers</strong>

The urban areas of Nepal are growing fast with which the challenges to address the woes of the people living under the poverty line in the urban areas is rising too. You can scorn at them as slum dwellers or poor, the real problem is the general mindset that city is the place for only well-to-do people and not for the poor. To change this mindset, we need response programs, and such programs are lacking.

Around 12 percent of the total population of the country is homeless, states the latest National Census Report.

On top of that frequent natural calamities such as floods and landslides are adding to the number of homeless. Those who were self-reliant or well-to-do yesterday are helpless today. Where will they go? In absence of timely intervention from the concerned authorities to facilitate their rehabilitation and livelihood in a package, many of them are compelled enter urban areas for survival. And they are most likely to find shelter at slums at some neglected quarters of the cities.

To give voices to such people, who are bereft of basic rights such as education, health, shelter, water and sanitation, Nepal is also marking the World Habitat Day on Monday.

Much of the issues have been covered by the National Habitat Policy drafted by the Ministry of Urban Development, which the UN Habitat also backs.

It´s high time that all the stakeholders build a common understanding to address the voices of slum dwellers as we celebrate the day with the slogan “Voice from Slum”.

Nepal celebrated 18th Annual National Earthquake Safety Day (ESD) on January 16, 2016. The ESD is a day to raise awareness and share information and experiences on disaster/earthquake risk reduction. This year, National Reconstruction Authority decided to start the campaign of reconstruction on the same day.

Addressing the function, Premier Oli stressed on the need to rebuild Bungamati and similar other traditional towns considering earthquake resilient safety measures.

Bungamati is one of the traditional settlements in Kathmandu valley with historical and cultural significance that faced huge damage during the earthquake in April, 2015. It is a seventh century ancient settlement inhabited by approximately six thousand people.

United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), Katholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) of Belgium, Shelter Program of ARCADIS conducted a series of local level consultations and an intensive assessment of resources including cultural and social values of Bungamati before preparing the ‘Bungamati Rebuilding Plan’ at the initiation of Karyabinayak Municipality and Bungamati Reconstruction Committee.

‘The government is always ready to support rebuilding historical and ancient heritages of Bungamati and affected districts’, said Ananda Prasad Pokharel, Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation.

During the program, a tripartite agreement for rebuilding Bungamati was signed by the municipality, Bungamati Reconstruction Committee and UN-Habitat. UN-Habitat has been providing technical assistance in preparing rebuilding plan of Bungamati. This initiative aims to demonstrate how traditional settlements can be revitalized and made livable and vibrant townships through people's 'process'. The approach envisioned includes providing support to build local institutions, develop the charter and support to build funding mechanism.

Local people of Bungamati have expressed their happiness for beginning reconstruction campaign from their town.

Deputy Prime Minister and ministers and senior government officials including representatives from I/NGOs, donor agencies, industrialists, private sector, teachers, students and general public joined the function.

The function to mark 18th national ESD was organized by Karyabinayak Municipality, Bungamati Reconstruction Committee and UN-Habitat.

<strong>Prakash Singh </strong>

Bajura,

Despite several governmental and non-governmental organisations’ campaigns aiming to eradicate Chhaupadi system, a separate trail has been constructed for women to use during menstrual cycle in Bajura of late, making the mockery of the efforts to rid the area of the ill practice.

A 400-metre track was developed spending around Rs 25,000 from the state coffers in Jukot VDC of the district. “A separate track was built so that women do not cross ways with the temple on way to upper hill area during their cycle. God might get angry if they touch the temple while climbing up and down the hill,” said a local Prem Rokaya.

Nepali Congress leader and a local of the area Kalki Shahi said that the decision to this effect was made after an all-party meeting at the VDC level.

“There lies Kalshil Temple at Dhoggani of Jukot VDC which is a common route frequently used by locals. Thus, the alternative route was developed with the consensus from all VDC dwellers,” said Karbir Shahi, account assistant of the VDC, adding, “We released the budget after villagers insisted on developing a separate route for women during their menstruation cycle.”

Meanwhile, local women leader Kabita Shahi said that they decided to manage separate route for women with the consent from all locals, including women. “All women gave the nod,” she added.

However, Jagat Bahadur Thapa, a first class non-gazetted officer at District Development Committee, argued that the budget cannot be used to promote such sort of ill social practices. “Local development officer is on leave these days. If VDC officials are found guilty after investigation, they will be face legal action,” he said. In addition, a separate tap has been set up for the women going through their period in same village.

According to the Chhaupadi trend, unmarried women during their monthly cycle stay in a separate shed away from their home for seven days while the restriction for married women is for five days. The practice has made women more vulnerable to psychological and physical stress. They are also exposed to terror of being attacked by wild animals and many have become victims of rape.

Although women are gradually voicing against the deep-rooted conservative belief, it has been a futile effort so far. During Chhaupadi, women cannot stay with their families, touch grains or milk cows and buffaloes.

In his statement to mark the occasion, United Nations Secretary General Mr. Ban Ki-moon “With the decision by the United Nations General Assembly to establish World Cities Day, we now have an annual date on which to celebrate one of humankind’s greatest and most complex creations.”

The global celebration was hosted by Shanghai Municipal People’s Government, in collaboration with the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, China and UN-Habitat.

Mr. Ban added: “This new day is one of the legacies of Expo 2010 Shanghai, at which the international community explored urban best practices and concepts from all over the world.  So it is fitting that Shanghai is hosting the main inaugural event of this new UN observance.”

According to the Secretary General, the theme of this first World Cities Day — “Leading Urban Transformations” — highlights the pioneering power of cities.

“Today is also a moment to recognize the contributions of mayors and other city leaders.  Urban transformations require political will and the capacity to coordinate many actors and stakeholders. Mayors give voice to their citizens and play a central role in building well-planned cities and making them engines of prosperity, innovation and inclusiveness,” he said.

UN-Habitat Executive Director Dr. Joan Clos emphasized the transformative potential of cities to contribute to sustainable development. “Cities are able to create positive transformations if well-planned and well-managed. A well-planned city making use of optimal density can provide services to its citizens in a more efficient and affordable manner than sprawling urban areas,” he said.

The Shanghai celebration took place at the Expo Park, where some 300 participants attended , including participation by high-level officials from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and other national government institutions in China; top officials from UN-Habitat and other stakeholders from around the world.

Meanwhile, while in Nairobi on official mission, Mr. Ban visited an exhibition mounted by UN-Habitat as part of the Urban October. The exhibition features a paper city and an exhibition on urban issues mounted by professional photographers based in Kenya.

“In the run up to the United Nations Conference of Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III in 2016), this first World Cities Day is an opportunity to consider a new urban paradigm. Instead of waiting to see how our cities turn out, let’s seize this opportunity to start to shape the cities we need,” said Dr Clos.

UN Habitat claimed that Green Homes, a joint United Nations Human settlement programme, launched by the organisation in collaboration with Nepali partners one-and-a-half years ago in Pokhara had been successful.

Santosh Shrestha, an engineer at UN Habitat, said at a function held today that the green homes project was launched with financial aid from European Union to combat global warming for sustainable settlement promotion in Nepal.

The project said that green homes aimed to properly utilise natural resources including water, electricity, and forests for generations. It also focuses on waste management. Use of proper construction materials, energy conservation management, right designing to let sun rays enter the house, water utilisation and waste management among others are its key priorities, said officials.

The project aims to maintain the sound health of people, an eco-friendly lifestyle, and to promote human responsibility towards the earth through minimisation of exploitation of natural resources and control of green house effects, among others. Engineer Shrestha said that sustainable settlement was launched in Lalitpur and Pokhara sub-metropolis and Dharan municipality.

Executive Officer Mahesh Baral of Pokhara sub-metropolitan city said that they were urging city dwellers to stress on green homes for favourable environment.

Engineer Sharada Mohan Kafle, focal person, of the programme, said that people needed to focus on designing and location of their door, window, ventilation and construction materials, among others, before constructing their settlement.

UN Habitat has been launching various programmes all over the world to minimise the effects of global warming and green house gases.

Such homes are expected to solve the problem of water scarcity, waste management and environment pollution.

The Dharan sub-metropolitan authority has envisioned a plan of action for transforming Dharan into a city of green homes within three years. For this, it has already decided to provide attractive facilities and substantial discounts to those who build green homes, the sub-metropolitan authority informed.

“We´ve decided to waive 50 percent of the charges while approving the maps and designs for green homes. In addition, the designs for green homes will be approved promptly,” said Suraj Shrestha, planning section chief at the sub metropolitan city.

The sub metropolitan authority would felicitate owners of three well-built green homes, according to Shrestha, who has also been designated as the focal person for the green homes project in Dharan.

The plan would be brought into effect from next year on the occasion of World Environment Day.

“We´re ready to provide technical assistance to those opting for green homes construction,” Engineer Shrestha added. “We would also provide them with 25 percent of total estimated cost if they are using rainwater harvesting, solar system and biogas technologies for the green homes.”

The implementation of the ´green homes´ project that has commenced in Dharan since the last year is underway. So far, it has formed a working committee to implement the project. With technical assistance from UN Habitat, Dharan, Lalitpur and Pokhara are the cities in the country promoting green homes.

The government is also preparing the guidelines for green homes to make the construction eco-friendly and discourage rampant construction of concrete buildings.

Meanwhile, Santosh Shrestha, an expert on sustainable housing, said that adoption of green homes concept is the need of the hour to minimize adverse impact on the environment. He further said that green homes are environment friendly because they are sustainable. It would save energy, water and contribute to creating a healthy environment.

<strong>JANAKPUR, Jan 3</strong>: When it comes to cleanliness and hygiene, the Tarai districts have little to boast of. Out of the 72 VDCs, five municipalities and one sub-metropolitan city in Dhanusha district, only two VDCs have been declared open defecation-free (ODF)\ so far. Only one VDC in Mahottari and none in Sarlahi has attained that status.

Against this background, the Ministry of Urban Development has launched a campaign to promote hygiene and cleanliness in nine Tarai districts. The government expects to make at least 10 VDCs in Dhanusa, 18 in Mahottari and 15 in Sarlahi open defecation-free in 2015.

According to Urban Development Minister Narayan Khadka, the stakeholders have been mobilized in the nine districts of Sunsari, Saptari, Siraha, Dhanusha, Mahottari, Sarlahi, Rautahat, Bara and Parsa. “I am putting in every effort to speed up the cleanliness campaign”, said Khadka, who was in Dhanusa district last week to inaugurate the cleanliness drive. On Sunday he was in Kushaha, Saptari district to promote the campaign. Next day, he met the residents of Bardia and encouraged them to keep their surroundings clean.

Meanwhile, during a workshop organized by the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS), Director General of the Department Rambrisha Shah stressed the need to improve the image of a historic city like Janakpur. Stating that the uniqueness of Janakpur is easily overshadowed by the dirt and filth in the surroundings, he said. ""We should feel ashamed of ourselves if we do not make enough effort to show what Janakpur really stands for."" Pointing out that proper sanitation is long overdue in the city, he said, ""We have to take care of its rich culture and heritage.""

It is not that Janakpur has never seen any cleanliness drive before. However, the lack of consistency in these endeavours did not help. According to Shah, people in Janakpur do not mind offering money to temples and deities, but due to lack of awareness, they are less concerned about health and hygiene.

“We spend lots of money building temples and shrines, but how wise are we to ignore sanitation in our midst?” he said.

President Ram Baran Yadav in 2011 announced a master plan for cleanliness aimed at making Nepal as a whole open defecation-free, informed Shah.

<p style=""color: #000000;"">Today, the UN and its humanitarian partners appealed to international donors to provide <a style=""color: #296ab3;"" href=""http://bit.ly/1GFZsUL"" target=""_blank"">US$415 million to respond to the humanitarian needs</a> of those affected by the earthquake over the next three months. Growing humanitarian needs include food, drinking water, shelter and medication.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">“The timing of the interventions remains of the essence,” said the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nepal Jamie McGoldrick. “Although I am heartened and encouraged by the progress of the response to date, efforts need to be maintained and stepped up to ensure vital assistance reaches all the affected, especially those in the remote areas,” he said.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">Strong aftershocks continue to threaten the lives of thousands of people, many of whom are sleeping outdoors – for fear of falling debris from aftershocks – in damp and cold conditions, making them vulnerable to respiratory infections. Rapidly deteriorating weather, as the monsoon season approaches, is likely to become an added logistical challenge to the provision of humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">In response to the devastation, United Nations Emergency Coordinator Valerie Amos released US$15 million on Monday through the <a style=""color: #296ab3;"" href=""http://www.unocha.org/cerf/"">Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)</a> to enable humanitarian aid organizations to rapidly scale up operations and provide immediate assistance to people in need.

An orientation program for project implementing partners and staff members was organized on 7th June and they were oriented on administrative procedures and project reporting framework on 19th June, 2015. In an orientation program, Santosh Shrestha, Team Leader of the project highlighted project objectives and its implementation modalities.

The nine-month long project funded by the Government of Japan will directly benefit 2200 households, out of which 1600 will receive material support for temporary shelter while the remaining 600 households will be provided with proper shelter solutions (repair and rental subsidy) in three districts in Kathmandu Valley. This target is projected to benefit approximately 13200 individuals.

The project operates ten Community Information Centers (CIC), two in each five selected districts that serve as an information hub for communities seeking technical information on ‘building back better and safer’.

Members of Constituent Assembly, senior leaders of district level political parties, high level officials from different ministries, security agencies, and development organizations were the special guests of the programme. Representatives of local organizations, civil society, CFUGs, M WASH CC, V WASH CC, W WASH CC, Women's Groups, Child Clubs, Teachers, Students, media person and about 5000 local people participated in the programme.

The ODF declaration ceremony was inaugurated by Chief Guest Honorable Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Mr. Bamdev Gautam, who also administered an oath to everyone present to sustain the ODF status and move towards total sanitation. He also congratulated all stakeholders for being the first district in the Terai to be declared as ODF and all citizens of Bardiya could proudly claim that they are civilized people.

Member Secretary of D WASH CC Mr. Arjun Kumar Bam gave a welcome speech and Chairperson of D WASH CC Mr. Dilli Ram Sigdel presented a report on the district ODF campaign. According to the report, all 85,377 households in the district now has toilets.

Special guest Secretary of Health and Population Ministry Mr. Shanta Bahadur Shrestha focused on various diseases which are born in lack of proper sanitation and thanked to all Bardiya people for sanitation improvement. Deputy Director General of DWSS Mr. Sunil Kumar Das thanked to Bardiya inhabitant and suggested to all for the sustainability of the sanitation campaign adopting the indicator of total sanitation.
South Asian Technical Advisor of UN-Habitat Mr. Bhusan Tuladhar said that the ODF declaration of Bardiya was very special and gave three strong messages – (1) Sanitation campaign can succeed in the Terai, inspite of soci-cultural, financial and technical challenges; (2) Even the poor and marginalized communities such as ex-Kamaiyas and landless people can invest in toilets and (3) Even after natural disasters, such as the flood that affected Bardiya last year, the sanitation campaign can be brought back on track if the local people and local stakeholders demonstrate the commitment to do so. This is a very strong message at this time when the sanitation campaign in districts such as Dolakha and Sindhupalchowk have come to halt becuase of the earthquake of 25 April.

2157,5/25/2015 18:01,"<strong>Kathmandu, 25 May</strong> – One month after the earthquake of 25 April, the National Planning Commission of Nepal hosted an expert meeting convened by UN-Habitat to review the challenges of urbanization and reconstruction. The lead questions are to identify urban drivers for national recovery and to encourage future resilient urbanization.

Unplanned urbanization expands future risk. It will be extremely challenging to undertake reconstruction in many high-density urban neighbourhoods and in dense historic urban and peri-urban townships. A new surge in migration from affected rural areas is likely to further impede the complexities. The urban poor are most at risk.

A key question emerging is the provision of safe rental accommodation, from hosting in the forthcoming months to encouraging the building new rental housing stock. The urban poor depend largely on often overcrowded rental accommodation, which represents the bulk of the damaged urban properties in Kathmandu, as they were of poor quality and floors had been added incrementally without supervision. Damage assessments are still underway.

The same situation is evident in neighbourhoods with cheap guesthouses lodging visitors from rural areas and those waiting to travel to overseas jobs. The Mitrangar New Buspark guesthouse neighbourhood in Kathmandu (pictured) experienced heavy damage.

<strong>Building back better</strong>

In the past 30 days, UN-Habitat has been assisting the Shelter, WASH and Early Recovery Clusters and has mobilized assistance from Japan and Chinese, Norwegian and Swedish partners to first assist vulnerable households and subsequently expand the advocacy for building back better in rural and semi-urban communities.

The United Nations has started updating its Appeal taking into account the more recent quake of 12 May and the approaching monsoon. Shelter and access to safe water remain acute needs for about 500,000 households, of which one out of four are very vulnerable.

The intensity of the twin earthquakes has caused extensive damage, particularly in rural areas and small market towns. UN-Habitat has started to coordinate a Working Group on Shelter Recovery, mounting a collaboration with the International Federation of the Red Cross – the Shelter Cluster Lead, the Norwegian Refugee Council standby roster, NORCAP and Habitat for Humanity.

This group will work with partners and the Government to seek new and effective cooperation frameworks in the months ahead, building on good practices and owner-driven and government-supported shelter reconstruction established in earlier disasters.

<strong>Planning for urban growth</strong>

UN-Habitat is also providing experts for the formulation of the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), with regard to housing and settlements, water and sanitation and governance.

UN-Habitat has organized consultations with key national resource persons to introduce options to address the emerging urban challenges. Specific area-based typologies for recovery and reconstruction must be recognized, provided with participatory planning assistance and supported with appropriate financial mechanisms. Planned extensions of market towns and of semi-urban areas in the Kathmandu Valley are required.

Furthermore, the rate of urbanization is expected to further increase after the earthquakes in the lowland “Terai” areas. Where urban development is fast, rapid planning should aim at preventing new areas which are underserviced and overcrowded. They can introduce more efficient urbanisation patterns, better public spaces and more adequate supporting regulations.

<p style=""color: #000000;"">Currently, 2.4 billion people, close to 35 percent of the global population, lack access to decent sanitation. Of those, close to a billion defecate in the open. Diarrheal disease, largely caused by poor sanitation and hygiene, is a leading cause of malnutrition, stunting and child mortality, claiming nearly 600,000 lives of children under 5 every year.

These activities are community-led, support national efforts, and bring together a diverse group of stakeholders in order to address, at a large scale, the severe deficiencies in access to sanitation and hygiene.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">The GSF is a pooled financing mechanism with the potential to further accelerate access to sanitation for hundreds of millions of people over the next 15 years. Between 2014 and mid-2015, the GSF reported a 95 percent increase in people with improved toilets across target regions in <a style=""color: #1d9cab;"" href=""http://wsscc.org/global-sanitation-fund/#GSFCountries"">13 countries</a>. During this same period, the GSF has also supported a more than 40 percent increase in the number of people living in open defecation free environments in those same areas. The United Nations system has identified global funds as an important tool to enable member countries to achieve their national development targets, including those for sanitation and hygiene. <a style=""color: #1d9cab;"" href=""http://unsdsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/150505-SDSN-Financing-Sustainable-Development-Paper-FINAL.pdf"">Read more</a></p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">Results reported by the GSF have been achieved due to the work of more than 200 partners, including executing agencies and sub-grantees composed of representatives from governments, international organizations, academic institutions, the United Nations and civil society. One of the strongest success factors in the GSF approach is that it allows flexibility for countries to develop their programmes within the context of their own institutional framework and according to their own specific sanitation and hygiene needs, sector capacity and stakeholders. This implementation methodology is used to reach large numbers of households in a relatively short period of time and is vital for scaling up safe sanitation and hygiene practices.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">The Governments of Australia, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom have contributed to the GSF since its establishment in 2008.

The United Nations released the Flash Appeal for Response to the Nepal Earthquake (link to Flash Appeal), appealing for USD 415 million for the first three months. In response, the Government of Japan has decided to support UN-Habitat’s humanitarian response for shelter provisions prior and during the forthcoming monsoon. For this a USD 800,000 Emergency Grant Aid will be mobilized through UN-Habitat to provide assistance in the districts of Sindhupalchowk, Dolakha and three districts in Kathmandu Valley.

The Emergency Grant Aid will be utilized to provide material support for communities in building 1600 temporary shelters and operate eight Community Information Centers (kiosks), two in each five selected districts. The kiosks will serve as an information hub for communities seeking technical information on ‘building back better and safer’.

The staff team selected for the project (Shelter Provision for the Most Vulnerable before &amp; during the Monsoon) supported by the Government of Japan has already been oriented on project approaches and its objectives.

In addition, UN-Habitat is supporting the Government of Nepal’s Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) initiative to determine the impacts of the devastating earthquake.

The initiative supported by UN-Habitat through <a href=""https://mojang.com/about/"" target=""_blank"">Mojang </a> funding and implemented by Center for Integrated Urban Development (CIUD) provides technical and material support to communities in building 12 semi-permanent shelters to needy families.

The village was hardly hit by the first Earthquake and the resulting aftershocks with barely any house standing. This has had huge repercussions with locals as they had no safe space to live in. But the shelter program launched by CIUD/UN-Habitat has raised a hope for the local people.

<strong>Feeling safer</strong>
One of the families impacted was Krishna Devi Maharjan and her family of four including herself, her husband and two children aged eighteen and thirteen.  The Maharjans described the fear they were in, as the earthquake brought down their houses.

With no place to live, they were all forced to sleep in their tomato farm nearby. However, the temporary shelter program has given them a safe space to live in.

Although their shelter is still in the final stages of completion, Krishna Devi and her family have already started living there and are positive about the prospect of having a completed temporary house.

<strong>More needy population</strong>
Four year old girl, Angel Maharjan, who lives in the same village, survived the earthquake as she was trapped in her home which luckily did not collapse. However, the locals described that, had she come out of her home, she would probably have faced a collapsing temple just in front of her home. The home itself has been heavily damaged but is still standing.

Other locals too described how they were lucky enough to have escaped major injuries or even death as their homes came rumbling down.

Miss Maharjan’s family, currently living in a tent, like others in her community is also looking for support in building temporary shelters.",Construction of temporary shelters gaining momentum,publish,construction-of-temporary-shelters-gaining-momentum,6/17/2015 16:29

<p style=""color: #000000;"">Nagendra Jha, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Land Reforms and Management, said completion of land use mapping will help resolve issues related to land conflicts.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">We have not been able to do much in land use mapping due to lack of clear land use policy, said Jha at a seminar on ‘Issues and Challenges on Land Policies in New Context’ organised by the UNDP in collaboration with UN-Habitat and International Organisation of Migration in the capital yesterday.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">“It is of utmost importance to develop land use mapping to allocate land for house construction, settlements, industry establishment and squatter relocations in the aftermath of the April 25 earthquake. In order to develop land use mapping, technical, political, social and scientific approaches should be used by all the national and international stakeholders,” said Jha, adding that the government is not resourceful enough for the relocation of squatters and displaced communities in the time of crisis, disasters and conflicts.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">Public properties can’’t be used for relocation and re-settlement of the displaced and squatters.</p>

In addition, they also raised awareness on safe drinking water, sanitation and hygienic practices to more than 3000 earthquake affected families and students. The volunteer teams were mobilized by UN-Habitat in association with Pachim Paila, Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO), Hamro Sahayog, SOYA and We Inspire Nepal (WIN), and in close collaboration with District WASH Coordination Committees and local NGOs from 8th to 12th June, 2015 in Sindhupalchowk and Dolakha district and from 5th to 11th June, 2015 in Bhaktapur district as part of the 16th National Sanitation Action Week.

In total, 52 volunteers from Kathmandu visited Boch and Suspachhemawati VDCs in Dolakha district, Irkhu and Sipapokhari VDCs in Sindhupalchowk district, and Manjushree, Suryabinayak, Changunarayan, Aanantalingeswor, Bhaktapur and Madhya Thimi Municipalities in Bhaktapur district.

The volunteers were able to revive 55 toilets in Sindhupalchowk, 16 in Dolakha and 30 toilets Bhaktapur district. Before the earthquake, UN-Habitat had been supporting sanitation campaigns in all these three districts. While Bhaktapur had already been declared as open defecation free, Sindhupalchowk and Dolakha were very close being declared as ODF with more than 99 percent of the houses having toilets. However, as all three districts were among the 14 most affected districts, the earthquake damaged many toilets in these districts and brought the sanitation campaigns in these districts to a screeching halt. The youth campaign has not only revived over 100 toilets in these districts but has also revived the sanitation campaign in these toilets. It has shown that although the earthquake has damaged many toilets, they can be revived with local participation.

According to Supriya Basnet, a volunteer mobilized at Irkhu, Sindhupalchowk, most of locals were already aware about safe drinking water, proper sanitation and hygiene practices implanted by UN-Habitat before the earthquakes. No open defecation was found in the VDC and the people were either using partially damaged toilets or sharing neighbours’ toilets. This clearly indicates that although the earthquake may have destroyed many of the toilets in the districts, it was not able to destroy the toilet made in the minds of the people",Youth Volunteers Revive Over 100 toilets in four days,publish,youth-volunteers-revive-over-100-toilets-in-four-days-2,9/18/2015 16:14

She is planning to construct an earthquake resistant home within the coming year. Nirmala, who has been going through quite a tough period in her life, strongly believes that her neighbors and the organization Panga Woman Cooperative (PWC) members are ready to construct earthquake resistant houses as long as the government provides some financial support.</div>
<div class=""googlead300-content"" style=""color: #444444;""></div>
<div class=""itemFullText"" style=""color: #444444;"">When speaking to Nirmala and her fellow community members, all of them were quick to note that not a lot of support has been provided to Panga. They shared their frustrations arising from the hardships in raising children while living in small tents. The female members were also particularly concerned about their own wellbeing while living in open areas during this difficult period.Panga VDC has been hit hard by the earthquake. A total of 522 homes were destroyed while 11 people lost their lives. According to Menuka Maharjan, chairperson of PWC, till date 195 semi-permanent shelters have been constructed with help from the Government of Nepal, UN-Habitat and other stakeholders. Most of these shelters have mainly been provided to pregnant, single women, along with those who are sick and injured.Nirmala also got a temporary shelter made from metal and other local materials. She now has a private living space for herself and her family of five. ""Finally I have a temporary house where I can live during the monsoon. I can store my harvest and other kitchenware. This temporary shelter was constructed using local materials including bamboo and we completed the construction within a few days. I want to thank the people involved for their support,"" she said with a smile.

Nevertheless, more than half of the affected population of Kritipur is still being forced to live in damaged homes because the temporary shelters aren't enough. With the hope that their coming generations do not have to face these harsh conditions, Nirmala and her colleagues stress the importance of constructing earthquake resistant homes in the future.

Kirtipur is not the only area affected by the earthquake. According to data and sources from the government, approximately 595,728 houses were destroyed and another 279,828 were damaged by the quakes across the country. Hundreds of thousands of people continue to remain in makeshift shelters, as more than 1,17,000 people were displaced. Many of the affected families are also still struggling to recover and rebuild their livelihoods.

It's estimated that around 43,500 households have still not received adequate supplies or, in some cases, have not even been reached yet. The government relief packages are yet to reach many remote earthquake-affected villages. In this situation NGOs, INGOs, other humanitarian support organizations and some youth representatives from various political parties are trying to get access to such villages to help the public build temporary shelters. This has been much appreciated by the local communities.

Many people are going to construct their new homes once this monsoon season is over. Earthquake affected district Dolakha, Sunkhani-2 inhabitant Bidur Sharma who is a teacher at a local school said, ""We will begin our reconstruction after Tihar. We want to build an earthquake resistant building. However, there isn't any information center or technical manpower in our village. We need to visit Kathmandu in order to get the necessary information and ideas regarding earthquake safety measures, which is not practical.""

To address the people's demand, the district development committee along with UN-Habitat and partners are going to establish an information center in Dolakha. ""To build safer homes, it's vital to follow the National building code and as a teacher, I'm aware about this,"" said Sharma.

On the other hand in Kathmandu, more than 90 percent of the houses have been built without following the National Building Code. Majority of the housing units have been constructed by the people as per their own needs and budgets.

The National Building Code has been approved and implemented since 2003. The practice of applying building code has already been started in government as well as private buildings. However, this requires massive training as well as dissemination including public awareness programs. Also, the importance of the building codes should be stressed upon as the implementation and execution of it could play a significant role in designing earthquake resistant buildings.

Deputy Director General of Department of Urban Development and Building Construction Shivahari Sharma said, ""Proper implementation of the National Building Code can be the vital key in reducing earthquake risks in Nepal. This is the right time to circulate the message and make people aware about the significance of the building codes."" Till date, the building code has been implemented in thirty municipalities only.

Engineer Padma Sunder Joshi, Urban Planner and UN-Habitat Country program manager said, ""Most of the Nepalis people made unsafe buildings. Therefore, we lost thousands of lives and lost properties worth billions of rupees. The unwillingness in implementing and following national building code is the major cause of the massive loss and damage in this devastating earthquake.""

Ever since the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck on April 25 this year, the country has faced numerous major aftershocks. Thousands of people still live in temporary shelters and the possibility of construction post the monsoon season is high. Generally during an earthquake approximately 80 percent of the losses are caused due to destruction of buildings. Therefore, it's important to follow the building codes and build safer building that can withstand earthquakes given the fact that we live in a seismically active zone.

2303,7/3/2015 11:31,"July 03 2015 - The Parliamentary Agriculture and Water Resources Committee has cleared the way for implementation of the amended Lands Act 2021 (1964) that had long been under serious debate.

The Act has been amended amid growing concern about increasing fragmentation of fertile land and unplanned urbanisation. In an absence of effective land use and integrated resettlement policies, Nepal suffered much damage in the recent earthquake.

After the Act is enforced, landowners will not be able to build houses/industries or choose site for the development of a settlement beyond the land allocated for such purposes.

The Act will not allow the people to inhabit in areas where there is evidence to show the existence of minerals and mines, forest, areas of cultural and historical importance, river and sites to risk prone areas, not suitable for human settlements, like slopes, inundation and landslide.

For the optimum utilisation of land, the committee has divided land into 12 zones. They are agricultural, residential, commercial, industrial, mines and minerals, extraction of construction mineral sites, land of cultural and archaeological importance, river and rivulets, ponds and lakes, forest, public uses/open, risk-prone areas and others.

“Under the amended provision, land will be used under which it has been allocated purposefully,” Gagan Thapa, chairman of the committee. “The Act will not allow people to use their land haphazardly even if it is under their ownership. The Act will discourage plotting and construction in the arable land, according to the landlord wishes now.”

Due to the lack of a proper land use Act, haphazard settlement on the agricultural land has been on the rise. the country has also been facing deforestation and natural resources have depleted. The committee has decided to table the Bill at the parliament.

A meeting of the Legislative Parliament on November 18, 2014 had sent the draft of the Act to the committee for further discussion. The committee was told to discuss on the issue and sent the draft with its recommendations.

The committee also decided to form a seven-member sub-committee to discuss any complaints filed on the amended Act and study the implementation of the recommendations. Lawmaker Amrit Kumar Bohara has been named the chair of the sub-committee. Land Act (1964) was amended for the fifth time in 2053 BS (1996).

This accomplishment lauded by many, has given way to an additional $ 6.5 million funding aimed at thoroughly improving the sanitation wellbeing of the people living in the Terai region of Nepal.

The campaign which took off in 2014 is being implemented in 8 districts of the Terai region which include Bara, Parsa, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Dhanusha, Mahottari, Siraha and Saptari. All of these districts had an average of only 27 percent sanitation coverage before the initiation of the program. Therefore, with an aim to increase this coverage and diagnose the difficulties related to sanitation, the campaign has been focusing on consensus building, strategy planning &amp; coordination, capacity building, implementation of ODF campaign, monitoring, sanitation marketing and knowledge management. As of June 2015, the campaign has already aided in the construction of nearly 63,826 toilets, which has impacted the lives of more than 389,869 people across the Terai region. With 16 VDCs already declared ODF, 106,112 people are currently living in open defecation free environments

The progress showcased by the initiation of the Global Sanitation Fund proves that the Terai region can soon achieve a hundred percent sanitation coverage. Bardiya, which was a part of the first phase of GSF, was the first district to be declared ODF in Terai. The accomplishment shown by Bardiya can definitely act as an inspiration for the other 8 districts which are moving steadily towards being ODF districts, serving the government’s goal to attain universal access to improved sanitation by 2017.",Terai Sanitation Campaign Gaining Momentum,publish,terai-sanitation-campaign-gaining-momentum,9/18/2015 16:14

<strong>The ‘Green Homes’ Initiative</strong>

Green Homes or Sustainable Housing is an approach that includes household systems that reduce pressure on natural resources and carbon emissions, thus resulting in human wellbeing, social equity, and green economy. Besides energy efficient buildings, it also includes eco-friendly practices for water and waste management systems such as rainwater harvesting, and waste/wastewater recycling. Green homes are more than just green buildings – they reflect a sustainable lifestyle based on eco-friendly systems and behavior.

In order to address the urban climate change issues, as part of the Cities and Climate Change Initiatives (CCCI), UN-Habitat and partners are implementing  'Green Homes: Promoting Sustainable Housing in Nepal’ project in association with the Government of Nepal and the European Union.

This three-year project is implemented primarily in three cities of Nepal; Lalitpur, Pokhara and Dharan with wider impact to other municipalities.

2386,9/9/2015 18:04,"THE BUSINESS OF SUSTAINABLE, ECO-FRIENDLY, DISASTER-PROOF CONSTRUCTION

<strong>September 6 2015, Nivida Lamichhane | </strong>All would agree that the twin quakes were a wakeup call for Nepal. On many fronts we were caught unprepared. The industry that was the most shaken up however, I can safely say, is the construction sector. Staying in a house that is a load-bearing structure, and having spent many sleepless nights along with my family whenever aftershocks struck, I understand how critical construction material and technology has become now. At the recently concluded exhibition on sustainable housing at Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk, I was witness to a growing interest among visitors that were intent on new construction and modifying built structures with technology that is sustainable, ecologically friendly, and most importantly safe in the event of a natural disaster. This is in sharp contrast to the cost-cutting that consumers and construction professionals resorted to. Also, people have become much more conscious regarding building codes and quality of construction material, two areas that were blatantly ignored and compromised upon previously.

Having volunteered time at ABARI, a company specialising in construction using earth and bamboo, I am aware how locally available material can be used to build structures that are ecofriendly, economical in the long run, and sustainable – three parameters that is guiding mantra for construction professionals worldwide. To have an insider’s insight into the issue of reconstruction and rebuilding I met Dr Santosh Shrestha, Sustainable Housing Expert with UN Habitat, who is also one of the chief implementers of the Green Homes project in Nepal

According to him, there is a renewed sense of urgency among policy makers to ensure that building codes are updated and implemented effectively. This, Shrestha says, is also a great opportunity to implement safer and sustainable housing considering local climate conditions and multi-hazard safety measures. He also feels that there is genuine interest among the general public to understand safer technologies that are geared toward building sustainable residential or commercial properties. He stresses that the rebuilding effort should be economical, eco-friendly and sustainable and that modern technological innovations should take advantage of local building material and expertise. On the issue of prefabricated building material Shrestha has mixed opinion — there are pros and cons, he says. Although fast and easy to build and most likely to cause less damage to residents of a building during a quake because of lightweight construction, the technology may not be socially acceptable in far-flung, remote areas of the country which have the most rebuilding to do.

Also, economically prefab construction does not benefit the country’s economy because most of money spent is ploughed back to pay the country from where the technology/material have been imported. International agencies that are funding rebuilding efforts encourage the use of local resources, technology, and manpower in reconstruction and rebuilding efforts. Shrestha believes that the construction industry is on the verge of a huge shakeup that is going to benefit the consumers, give rise to a greener and safer society, as well as inject economic prosperity overall by encouraging entrepreneurship in this field.

Hemendra Bohara of ‘matoghar’ fame opines that interest in sustainable houses is definitely on the increase as a viable alternative to concrete ones. Matoghar incidentally is the first house in Budanilkantha that was built with rammed earth technology, It is beautiful, modern and Bohara claims is earthquake-resistant. He feels that more such examples need to be built to make people believe in the technology. Already, he shares, a hospital is being built in Accham and Kopila Valley School in Surkhet. An ideal case in sustainability, rammed earth buildings use earth from the local site. Use of cement still is minimal and no burnt bricks are used. With no additional finishing required on the walls and the thick earth walls keeping the interiors cool during summer and warm during winter, incorporating passive solar design, energy costs are simply struck off. If clients want to take a further jump onto the sustainability bandwagon, Bohara recommends that waste water treatment, rainwater harvesting, passive solar design, and solar power as a means of electricity generation, be incorporated to be truly green.

Both believe that it is time to raise voice for safe, sustainable and eco-friendly construction which has the power to propel Nepal into the global conservation and sustainability map.

In response to the earthquake of 25 April, the initiative aims to assist in the redevelopment of one of the hardest-hit historical areas of the Kathmandu Valley.

ARCADIS’ assistance is part of <em>Shelter</em>, a UN-Habitat-ARCADIS partnership aimed at improving the quality of life in rapidly growing cities around the world.

An extensive <em>Shelter</em> mission will take place between 24 August and 5 September and will see five ARCADIS staff travelling to Nepal, along with a team of remotely-based support staff, to support local municipalities and neighborhood groups in urban recovery and planning. In July two ARCADIS staff members worked with a UN-Habitat advisor to develop a project plan for the initiative’.

The <em>Shelter</em> team will work together with the Human Settlements, Urbanism and Strategic Planning programmes of the University of Leuven, Belgium, and with UN-Habitat staff. Their work will focus on support for the badly-damaged historic town of Bungamati (near Kathmandu city) to redevelop the city and prepare the municipality for sustainable urban growth with affordable housing at the center.

<strong>Combining good urban design with recovery strategies</strong>

Speaking about the initiative, Mr. Padma Mainali, the Joint Secretary Housing of the Ministry of Urban Development and himself a KULeuven alumni, commented that strategies for affordable housing, rebuilding and expansion in settlements like Bungamati should build on the extensive heritage and cultural legacies of Nepal and Kathmandu Valley.

If done well, pilots like these will inspire compact settlement rebuilding in all affected districts in Nepal, including the market towns and heritage townships in the worst affected rural areas.

Good quality urban design combined with recovery strategies are important issues for this historic town. The <em>Shelter</em> team brings expertise on urban planning and design, civil engineering, sanitation and water management, and on strategies to redevelop the local economy.
On a larger scale, support will be provided on assessment of master plans and sectoral plans for Kathmandu valley, followed by neighborhood profiling to determine “hotspots” where future planning support and action is most needed.","UN-Habitat, ARCADIS and KULeuven help rebuilding effort in Nepal",publish,un-habitat-arcadis-and-kuleuven-help-rebuilding-effort-in-nepal-2,9/10/2015 17:13

<div class=""itemIntroText""><strong>We should strictly enforce the National Building Code to minimize the future earthquake risks</strong>

Nepal was hit by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25. Subsequently, the country also faced numerous major aftershocks. In this disaster, the country had to bear huge infrastructure and human casualties. Thousands of people are still in temporary shelters. Reconstruction will resume after monsoon. In this situation, constructing safe, earthquake-resistant houses by effectively implementing the National Building Code (NBC) is important.</div>
<div></div>
<div class=""itemFullText"">Over 90 percent houses in Kathmandu have flouted the NBC. Majority of them were constructed on the basis of personal whims. NBC was approved and implemented in 2003 and the process of applying building codes has been started in public as well as private buildings. However, this requires massive training and public awareness programs.

Those involved in design and construction and in creating awareness, implementation and local execution of NBC could play significant role in earthquake resistant design of buildings. Proper implementation of NBC can reduce earthquake risks. This is the right time to circulate the message and make people aware about the significance of NBC. Till date, the building code has been implemented in only 30 municipalities across the country.

The majority of people in affected areas are still waiting financial support. According to Home Ministry, the earthquake that hit Nepal this year caused approximately 8,897 deaths. In Dolakha district, 177 people lost their lives while another 662 people were injured. Likewise, 48,880 houses have been destroyed and 3,120 houses damaged. Currently, 45,688 people in the district are forced to live in either tents or temporary shelters.

The family of Bhim Bahadur Bishwakarma, a Dolakha local, has been facing immense hardships after the recent earthquakes. Survived by his mother, wife and two sons, Bishwakarma, working in iron production, has a weak income source. After UN-Habitat provided him financial support, Bhim Bahadur was able to construct a 12x15 feet cottage for himself and his family in two days.

""I do not have any wealth and I have to pay loans. I don't think I can construct a home for at least three or four years now. So, this cottage is like a palace for me. However, it is still difficult to live when other community members insult me just because I was born a Dalit"", Bishwakarma said with tears in his eyes.

Likewise, Harimaya Bishwakarma from Kanchiko VDC is another earthquake victim. Her only home was destroyed. Harimaya wondered how she would construct another shelter all by herself. Weeping, Harimaya said, ""We had constructed the house with the money sent by my husband who toiled abroad for 12 years. My husband passed away six years ago. I am now living alone in this temporary shelter. My dreams have been shattered. Nevertheless, I at least have a shelter to live in."" She has a temporary shelter. However, the government should immediately start working on relocating these people to proper homes.

It is sad that people are still waiting for government support. Santosh Shrestha, a structural engineer and sustainable housing expert, said that to build earthquake resistant homes in districts like Dolakha, people need immediate financial support, as well as technical support. The government should provide this soon. Building codes have to be strictly implemented. Only then would it be possible to minimize earthquake risks across the country.</div>

After a series of local level consultations and an intensive assessment of resources including cultural and social values of Bungamati, Katholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) of Belgium, Shelter Program of ARCADIS and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) shared findings and proposed an action plan that could be rolled out immediately to rebuild Bungamati. The findings were shared by Annelies De Nijs and Stefanie Dens from KU Leuven.

This initiative aims to demonstrate how traditional settlements of Kathmandu Valley can be revitalized and made livable and vibrant townships through people's 'process'. The approach envisioned includes providing support to build local institutions, develop the charter and support to build funding mechanism.

Sharing about the damages due to earthquake in Bungamati, Prem Bhakta Maharjan, Chairperson of the Bungamati Temporary Shelter and Reconstruction Committee highlighted the importance of cultural values and identities of Bungamati and emphasized on adopting participatory approach in rebuilding where local people can make their voluntary contribution (in cash or kind).

<strong>THOMAS BOGATY | Kathmandu, September 14</strong>

Lack of appropriate urban planning and management in the aftermath of the April 25 earthquake is posing the risk of unmanaged settlement sprawls in the Valley.

Many urban poor from damaged rental houses have been displaced to temporary shelters and makeshift tents. The owners of quake-damaged houses are residing in temporary shelters roofed with zinc sheets procured from the immediate relief amount of Rs 15,000 provided by the government.

Padma Sundar Joshi, Habitat Programme Manager at UN-Habitat said, “The owners of quake-damaged houses and the urban poor are forced to live in temporary shelters as they cannot afford the hiked rent of safe buildings.”

When the urban poor and quake victims residing in temporary shelters populate the spaces, there is chance of informal settlement sprawl leading to new slums in future. Overcrowded temporary shelters require new drainage system, drinking water supply pipelines, electricity and alleys similar to slum areas.

Moreover, many rural quake victims have alsobeen temporarily relocated to open spaces in the Valley with a view to provide them temporary shelters and makeshift tents.

Bagmati Riverbank slums at Thapathali and Sinamangal are examples of slums born of temporarily relocated disaster victims in the past.

According to Joshi, homeless quake victims on the outskirts of the Valley are taking agricultural land on lease to construct temporary shelter. The budget of Rs 200,000 allocated by the government is insufficient for constructing spacious permanent buildings.

“These areas on the outskirts of the Valley might turn into slums due to the sprawl of informal settlements on leased land,” said Joshi, adding that the populous homeless quake victims might claim ownership of the leased land to construct numerous temporary shelters.

The government, NGOs and INGOs have stressed on rural development plans without paying attention to urban planning. About 52 international stakeholders are investing over $3 million for uplifting rural settlement after the quake.

The budget of $2 million from World Bank and $1 million obtained from Japan International Cooperation Agency will also be invested in rural planning and development by the government, according to Joshi.

The project is funded by the Government of Japan.

The project that started in June this year has been providing material support (e.g. Corrugated Galvanized Sheets etc.) for 500 vulnerable families at four VDCs of Sindhupalchowk district (Irkhu, Kubinde, Sipapokhare and Bhotsipa) in building temporary shelter. The vulnerable families especially the single women, differently-abled and those from Dalit, Janajati communities and who lost their family member during the earthquake were given preference.

Along with temporary shelter construction and information services on safer construction techniques, the project aims to promote sustainable sanitation and good hygiene practices at communities.",Community Information Center formally opened,publish,community-information-center-formally-opened,9/22/2015 15:20

<p style=""color: #000000;"">Current policy and the interest of I/NGOs has been to rehabilitate rural areas, mostly because urban areas are too complex and challenging. Joshi highlighted migration patterns both within Kathmandu and between cities and rural areas in the post-quake scenario.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">There could be a surge in rural to urban displacement as there have been tremendous delay in disbursing Rs 200,000 for housing construction to be given by the government to property owners, whose houses were completely destroyed by the earthquake. “This delay might compel people to move to cities to find work while waiting for the government to assist with the rebuilding processes. In Kathmandu, a lot of people who lived on rented premises forced to leave the urban core as they were unable to afford sky-rocketing rents. This has led to growth in informal settlements.” he warned.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">As work on reconstruction continues, Joshi stressed the need to think about rebuilding not only through the limited framework of individual houses, but through a more comprehensive framework of human settlements. This means addressing livelihood, safe housing, local cultures and basic services concurrently.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">He added,” While discussing resilience in the context of post-quake rebuilding, spatial planning, functional schemes, and organisational/ institutional needs must be highlighted; but all work is futile unless programmes to bolster resilience are also linked to financial systems.”</p>

Mr. Shambhu KC, Joint Secretary Physical Planning and Urban Development at the Ministry of Urban Development formally opened the World Habitat Day 2015 celebration today amidst an exhibition focusing on ‘public spaces’ at the premises of the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC).

The theme for World Habitat Day 2015 is <strong><em>Public Spaces for All</em></strong>.

The United Nations has designated the first Monday of October of every year as World Habitat Day. The purpose of World Habitat Day is to reflect on the state of our towns and cities, and on the basic right of all to adequate shelter.

Highlighting the importance of public open spaces, Rabi Shah, Deputy Director General at the DUDBC under the Ministry of Urban Development stressed on the need to increase public open spaces for the safety of people during disasters.

Various programs have been planned on the occasion of World Habitat Day this year. A half-day workshop on the theme ‘Public Spaces for All’ will be jointly organized by DUDBC and UN-Habitat in Nepal on 5<sup>th</sup> October 2015 at DUDBC conference hall. On the same day Kathmandu Metropolitan City along with other partners is organizing a day long (7AM – 7 PM) campaign ‘<strong><em>Ktm Walks</em></strong>’ along Kilagal Nardevi stretch and in Itumbahal to promote walkability and different uses of public spaces.

According to a study done among cities around the world, out of 40 cities, only 7 allocated more than 20% of land to streets in their core and less than 10% in their suburban areas.

This year, the government has also announced to allocate budget to arrange one open space for every 25,000 population in the Kathmandu Valley.

In a message on the occasion of World Habitat Day 2015, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme - UN-Habitat’s Executive Director Dr. Joan Clos mentioned that the streets and public spaces have often been overlooked and undervalued, but are increasingly being considered the backbone of cities. The Sustainable Development Goals also aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.

UN-Habitat in Nepal urges all stakeholders and the general public to celebrate this day and promote establishment and promotion of public open spaces.

2633,9/30/2015 17:39,"Gangwon 1 October 2015- UN-Habitat and the International Urban Training Centre (IUTC) early last month held a training session focused on the use of land as an asset for cities to better organize urban development and create forms of self-financing urban infrastructure development. Learning activities provided participants with practical knowledge about the planning, design, implementation and management of land readjustment projects.

Some 22 participants from Bangladesh, Brazil, Bhutan, Indonesia, India, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam attended lectures, participated in field trips and actively engaged in exercises to develop skills on the use of land for guiding the development of their cities in a sustainable and efficient way.

The course began by examining the genesis and rationale of land development taking the long-standing Korean practice and know-how of the mechanism as the entry point for learning. Different land-based mechanisms were presented as tools to better distribute the social and economic benefits of public land-based policies, drawing on international examples.

Participants were exposed to an array of policy instruments and case studies developed to better capture the various dimensions of land development such as land value increment, property tax, value capture, transfer of development rights (TDR), etc. and took part in a role-playing exercise based on UN-Habitat’s practice.

UN-Habitat and IUTC trained urban practitioners in Land Readjustment_1The course finalized with Action Plans, whereby 64% of the participants expressed that this tool would be useful in their cities, while 9% are already implementing Land Readjustment projects and feel better prepared to implement them. This course series are jointly organized between UN-Habitat and IUTC. The next training course will focus on Integrated Water Management and will take place on November 3 – 10 November, 2015.

The United Nations has designated the first Monday of October of every year as World Habitat Day. The purpose of World Habitat Day is to reflect on the state of our towns and cities, and on the basic right of all to adequate shelter.

“The government will formulate stringent rules to promote creation of open spaces and its maintenance. In order to establish adequate public open spaces accessible to all, it requires a clear roadmap and support from all stakeholders concerned” said Mr. Narayan Khadka, Minister for Urban Development at the inaugural session of a half-day workshop on the same theme today.

Highlighting the values and importance of public open spaces, Professor Sudarshan Raj Tiwari stressed on the need of pedestrianization of streets and open spaces to create vibrant cities.

Four presentations on different aspects of public space management and conservation were made by experts at the workshop. Padma Sunder Joshi, Habitat Program Manager at the United National Human Settlements Programme in Nepal made his presentation highlighting the importance of community engagement in creating public spaces not just the design.

Yek Raj Adhikari, Architect from Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DU<img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-2690"" src=""http://unhabitat.org.np/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/whd2-300x190.jpg"" alt=""whd2"" width=""300"" height=""190"" />DBC) made a presentation on the government plans to build 10 new towns (e.g. Phidim, Dumre-Bhansar, Sanphe Bagar) at the junction of Middle Hills and the provisioning of public open spaces. Other presenters at the workshop were Pushkar Shrestha from Centre for integrated Urban Development and Om Thapaliya of HomeNet Nepal.

On the same occasion, Kathmandu Metropolitan City and UN-Habitat along with local organizations organized a day long campaign ‘<strong>KTM Walks</strong>’ along Kilagal Nardevi stretch and in Itumbahal to promote walkability and different uses of public spaces. Hundreds of people participated in the campaign and observed traditional arts and artifacts including traditional Newari music and dances.

This campaign in expected to boost government’s plan to arrange atleast one open space for every 25,000 population in the Kathmandu Valley. In order to create additional open spaces, the metropolis has also planned to procure privately owned buildings and land in city’s core areas.

2748,11/16/2015 10:56,"SINDHUPALCHOWK, Nov 10 2015: Fifty years old Teka Maya Shrestha’s house was among the 500 homes in Irkhu VDC that turned into rubble within a few seconds of the earthquake on April 25.  Her family managed to build a one-room cottage for its nine members. But the cottage proved incapable of protecting them from cold.

Teka Maya’s 77 years old mother-in-law and her grand-child have not been able to sleep as dew drops seep into their cottage through cracks at night.  “The blankets and floor become wet as droplets seep through the zinc sheets at night,” says Teka Maya.

The earthquake victims have started to place straw mat under the tin roof after seeing some NGOs and INGOs distributing styroform to the more marginalized among the victims in the neighborhood. “As soon as we harvest the paddy from the field, we make straw mat for both floor and roof,” she said.

Styrofoam or even the straw mat can be used under the tin roof as it can soak the dew and prevent the cold, says District Local Development Officer Krishna Bahadur Shahi. He also said that the local authority has got no instruction to launch any kind of support program for the locals.

At a time when the government has not introduced any winterization plans targeting the earthquake victims, the effort to soak the dew on roof and the use of improved stove could work as a room warmer, says Engineer Padma Sundar Joshi, program manager at the UN Habitat.

“The locals can cope with the winter at a small cost of Rs 10,000 with the locally available resources such as styroform, straw mat and improved stoves,” said Joshi.

While his organization and others have brought solutions for the problems resulting from the winter chill for the most needful households in the district, others can face the problem through self-initiation, he said.

The stove costs around Rs 2,500 and has been designed to throw the smoke out of the house and help keep the room warm. More locals would choose the improvised stove over the traditional ones as they consume less timber, said Irkhu VDC Secretary Chuda Mani Parajuli.

The traditional styled Newari house was built more than 85 years back during her grand -mother in law's time. It has been totally damaged from inside which needs to be reconstructed.

Remembering the day, she says, she was washing clothes in the ground floor and her two sons (13 years and 3 years) were watching televisions upstairs, on 3rd floor. As she felt the tremor she ran upstairs to take her sons but they couldn't come down. Along with the tremble she even saw her roof and walls being cracked and at that picky moment a thought stroke on her mind, no matter whatever happens we three are together recalling her husband who works in Dubai.

After staying in a community shelter provided by Kirtipur municipality for a month, she moved into a tent provided by Rara Hill. She was taking a<img class=""alignright  wp-image-2709"" src=""http://unhabitat.org.np/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo3-300x200.jpg"" alt=""photo3"" width=""198"" height=""132"" /> room on a rent for kitchen, as in a tent it is not possible to cook. It needed to pay Rs 2000/ month. When she got listed as a beneficiary under UN Habitat shelter support project, with support from the people of Japan, she felt that it was very relieved to get this support. As for now, the shelter has been completed; she has moved in along with her two sons and is very happy and satisfied.

She has the feeling of ownership. She further mentioned that this support has acted as a great relief in a time of need. She now timely gets connected with her husband who is working overseas and now even he is reassured regarding safety of his family here.

After Nepal’s devastating earthquake, his family house was destroyed.  “We’re a family of five, but we’ve been living separately ever since the earthquake”, laments Shrestha.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">One of the challenges Lochan faced is finding available land. His father, who passed away a few years ago, built the previous home for the family. “The land we’re building our temporary home on belongs to my relative. They agreed to let us use it for now.” He adds, ""we have to built a new house, but financially we won’t be able to built it now. Against this odd, with the assistance of Centre for Integrated Urban Development’s (CIUD) resources and technical support, we are building a temporary shelter with one bedroom and a kitchen to live in for the next 2-3 years.”</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;""></p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">Lochan’s family awaits until they have a stable roof over their head. For now, Lochan inches forward, learning the basic steps in building an earthquake proof shelter for his family. He is learning how to build safe temporary shelter that can protect them from harsh conditions like rain, strong wind and heat. Since the temporary shelter has basic considerations like proper digging for fixing of bamboos, cross bracing of bamboos, and use of proper fixing and jointing of bamboos and CGI sheets, CIUD team ensures that the beneficiaries will be safe from aftershock earthquakes as well.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">Lochan’s family is one out of the 13 houses in the ward that CIUD is assisting in setting up temporary shelters in the cluster of Sankhu. After <img class=""alignright  wp-image-2713"" src=""http://unhabitat.org.np/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Inside_1-300x224.jpg"" alt=""Inside_1"" width=""269"" height=""201"" />CIUD arranged the delivery of bamboo poles and CGI sheets from local vendors to the affected families, Lochan managed to set up his bamboo frame within 2 days. To follow up, CIUD technical field team facilitated an informal orientation to individuals from 5 families. In the orientation session, the local families learned on how to make their temporary shelter safe and strong using locally available materials and salvage materials. As a joint community effort, they agreed on completing Lochan’s temporary house first to serve as a sample temporary shelter for other families to refer to while they start building their own temporary shelters.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;""></p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">This is an example of effective local community participation and also organizational collaboration extended by CIUD team for the needy families in Sankhu. Recovering from a hazard of this scale requires information, resources, and teamwork in which Lochan and other families have demonstrated by their motivation and teamwork.</p>
<p style=""color: #000000;"">The step that started from Lochan’s family is certainly ‘ray of hopes’ that leads to the process where the affected people at the community level gain confidence to build their shelters in a safe and cost-effective way.</p>

2742,11/5/2015 11:05,"<strong>By Arjun Apabad, October 27 2015 </strong>, Masali Khadka of Sahare Village Development Committee (VDC) in Dolakha district is busy constructing her toilet these days. She plans to complete it before this Dashain festival. Toilet is must before Dashain as relatives gather during festival season. “It will be a shame if there is no toilet while they (relatives) come” she says.

Her house was damaged by the earthquake and so was the toilet. After the earthquake, she spent her time building a temporary shelter and plant crops so that she doesn’t miss the planting season.

People in her village are busy too. They are constructing new toilets and some of them renovating damaged ones. Community Development Forum (CDF) Nepal, a local NGO in Dolakha has been providing material support to renovate toilets.

Minuka Subedi, Assistant Program Coordinator at CDF said, her organization is providing toilet pan, cement, pipes and fittings and Corrugated Galvanized Iron (CGI) sheets to those whose toilets were completely damaged. Similarly, they are also providing CGI sheets to those whose roofs were damaged and pan and cement to the ones whose toilet pan were dismantled. According to Ms. Subedi, out of 693 toilets in the village, 143 were completely damaged and 314 were partially damaged.

People are involved in renovating their toilets as relatives gather during the festive season, says Lilaman Tamang of Japhe VDC. He added, it won’t be much of a problem to us but it would be difficult for guests if there is no toilet. CDF Nepal in Dolakha is supporting people in his village to rebuild toilets like in Sahare VDC.

The fuel crisis in the country has also affected the program. Though the program targeted to complete toilets before Dashain, it will not be possible as the construction materials could not be distributed on time due to fuel shortage says Sakuntala Karki, a local community mobilizer of the program. Community people have already done their part.

An elderly, Ganga Maya Magar is actively engaged in constructing her toilet. She was forced to defecate in open after her toilet constructed with support from VDC during Open Defecation Free (ODF) campaign last year, was destroyed by the earthquake. She is pleased to get support for toilet construction from CERF program implemented by CDF. “Good that the habit of defecating in toilet will not change” says Ms. Magar.

The earthquake had damaged many toilets in Dolakha district. According to Water Supply and Sanitation Divisional Office in Charikot, around 89.30 percent of toilets had been damaged in the district.

2804,11/27/2015 17:18,"<strong>Kathmandu, 25 November|</strong> Agitation and demonstrations for last 100 days have severely hampered the daily life of people. It is too difficult to pass the daily life as well, especially in the Tarai Madhesh region. Markets have been remained closed and road transportation also has been blocked.

It was the being reiterated that sanitation campaign can't be geared up in the Terai Madhesh Region of Nepal in easy way and within limited investment. Similarly, it had been strongly believed that subsidy was deep-tooted for sanitation promotion in this region.

Just contrary to the belief, Terai Madhesh People have shown eagerness to gearing up the sanitation campaign without any external subsidy during the period of agitations and unrest. As a result more than 13 thousand toilets have been constructed in last three months (August to October 2015). 3425 household level toilets have been constructed in Mahottari district alone during the last three months.

This result has been achieved due to continuity of sanitation promotion interventions in the community level even during the unrest. It

""People generally don't want to be back from their commitment if it is interlinked with dignity of life"", says Mr. Vijay Kumar Yadav, Coordinator of District WASH Task Force and sanitation focal person of District Development Committee, Dhanusha.

1953 toilets have been constructed in GSF Program areas of Dhanusha during the unrest. Similarly, 1080 in Bara, 2386 in Parsa, 1695 in Rautahat, 1171 in Sarlahi, 607 in Saptari and 771 toilets in Siraha district have been constructed during the agitations.

Almost entire working VDCs of GSF Program have been triggered for sanitation and hygiene behavior promotion. Sanitation action plans have been prepared in entire VDCs; daily action plan has been prepared and commitment has been taken from households for toilet construction. ""We made regular follow up of the plans and commitment in this period as well"", says Mr. Bishnu Kumar Bhandari, Program Coordinator of Janaki Women Awareness Society (JWAS).

Local markets also have been seemed supportive for sanitation promotion. ""People paid up to one thousand rupees for 30 KG cement in the market of Bardibas and brought it by bicycle"", informs Ms Bina Shrestha, one of the campaigners in Bateshwar VDC of Dhanusha district. The same situation existed in Rautahat district as well. ""People have bought the construction materials from Gaur while political movement and protest concentrated in Chandranigahapur; and vice versa"", says Mr. Deependra Kumar Thakur, District Coordinator of UN Habitat in Rautahat.

Toilet is not only a matter of facility, is it the symbol of dignity and satisfaction. Therefore, it seems necessary to interlink the sanitation facilities and behavior with dignified human life.",Terai adds up 13000 toilets even within political agitations,publish,terai-adds-up-13000-toilets-even-within-political-agitations,11/27/2015 17:21

After last year’s earthquake, Tundikhel was the only open area Kathmandu's residents could flock to. For months, the military parade ground was turned into a huge open-air shelter, just like after the 1934 earthquake.

The makeshift tents are now gone, and Tundikhel is once more the city’s green lung. But it is shrinking, as most of it has been fenced off by the Nepal Army. The Open Air Theatre is being turned into an underground parking lot. Over the years, Kathmandu’s dwindling open spaces are being increasingly encroached upon.

“Post-earthquake was the right time to plan and make people understand the value of public spaces, but unfortunately it is not going in that direction,” lamented Padma Sundar Joshi of UN-Habitat.

The International Organisation for Migration has identified 83 open spaces within the valley as refuges in case of future earthquakes. But Kathmandu needs more than just open areas, it needs public parks. Says Joshi: “Public parks are important from the social interaction aspect. A city without open spaces becomes more individualistic because there is no community interaction.”

There are only a handful of public parks at present. Some communities have taken matters into their own hands and started building their own, like Nandi Keshwor Garden in Naxal and Bankali Garden in Pashupati.

Shriju Pradhan, Chief of Heritage Conservation of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) says: “If we had local elections, representatives would be forced to be accountable and meet the public’s demand for open spaces.” KMC recently announced a plan to construct at least one park in each ward, and has set aside money for this. Environment Division Chief Rabin Man Shrestha says that the city can be made greener. “Ideally more than 10% of the city should be green, which is not the case right now.”

The park is managed by KMC, and sees up to 500 visitors in a day. “We understood the need for open space during the earthquake, as many people had shelter because of this park,” said park official Damodar Lama. Visitors are charged on entry.

Formerly a Malla-era garden, this is one of the few remaining green areas in Patan. “We want to give easy access to the locals. There is hardly any green space left in Kathmandu, so why should we close it?” asks Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust’s Rohit Ranjitkar.

A gateway for tourists entering Kathmandu from the airport, this triangular piece of land has received overnight makeovers during SAARC Summits. Plans to turn it into a park were announced in 1974 and several designs have been made, one of which includes underground parking, a meditation hall, souvenir shops, a tall Buddha statue in the middle, and handicraft stalls targeting tourists. But nothing has happened.

The Nepal Army controls the entire tract, and there is little left for public use. Part of the Open Air Theatre is currently a temporary bus park, and the Army is adding buildings in the open area right next to the Army Officer’s Club. “It is a public space. The Army does not have the right to construct anything, or stop movement of the people, in the area,” said Padma Sundar Joshi of UN-Habitat.

“In Kathmandu, staying indoors feels like living in a jail cell. Children get fresh air when they come here,” said the father of two, a resident of Gairidhara. His children’s other favourites are Bhrikuti Mandap and the Central Zoo in Jawalakhel.

Like Malla, many other area residents visit Nandi Keshwor Park in the early mornings and late afternoons as a way of spending some time out in the open. It took the vision of a committed community member, Narendra Shrestha, to realise everyone's dream of an outdoor space for recreation.

<img class=""wp-image-2930 aligncenter"" src=""http://unhabitat.org.np/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/eyR3TyG-300x169.jpg"" alt=""eyR3TyG"" width=""500"" height=""281"" /><em>                                          Pic: Smriti Basnet</em>

“As soon as people see open spaces, they think of building malls and making money out of that,” said Shrestha, who started designing the park in 2012. Shrestha says at that time the area had become a dumping ground for fallen structures and garbage.

Today, the ground has become a model park for many other communities. Carpeted with green grass, one corner of the ground is dedicated for children, with swings and slides. The pavement around the inner circle of the area is designated for strolling, and the park aims to build an acupressure path soon, which will cater particularly for visitors with high blood pressure. The area has six water recharge wells, dustbins sponsored by Hilltake, and benches and solar lights sponsored by Nepal Telecom.

To get things going, Shrestha raised Rs 360,000 from local institutions. The Community Police patrols the area and helps in weekly clean-up activities, and the area remains well-maintained and tidy. Modelled after Hyde Park in London, it has become the ideal destination for the community and a safe space in case of emergencies.

3030,5/29/2017 15:45,"29 May 2017, Kadaster International, UN-Habitat Nepal Country Office , GLTN Secretariat, and local civil society organization Human Rights Awareness and Development Center (HURADEC), have joined forces to support three communities in Nepal towards speeding up recovery from the 2015 earthquake and to improve tenure security through the application of Fit-for-Purpose Land Administration solutions.

From 18 May to 25 May 2017, a joint team from these organizations conducted community dialogues in the three communities, finalized a joint implementation plan including the identification of appropriate pro-poor and fit-for-purpose land tools and methodologies, and launched the project with the community leaders, government authorities and other key land stakeholders. The three communities which were heavily affected by the 2015 earthquake, are located in Dolakha district which is about 130 kilometers from Kathmandu.

While the three target areas experience common problems after the earthquake, they also have varying degrees of tenure security issues and have unique requirements for appropriate land governance interventions. Such interventions will facilitate the households in the communities to receive government grants to undertake long-awaited reconstruction of their housing destroyed by the 2015 earthquake.

The first community is part of Ward 2 of Bhimeshwor Municipality, which is deprived of basic infrastructure as the settlement is located in an area with difficult terrain. Many of the households are from the indigenous tribes and the Dalits, who are considered lower in the social caste system, and are still living in temporary shelters after their houses were destroyed by the earthquake. Farmers in this community have been engaging in subsistence farming as share-croppers and unregistered tenants for many decades with no written agreements or documentation. Therefore the joint project aims to strengthen the community’s capacity in recording and mapping people to land relationship using fit-for-purpose solutions to promote tenure security improvement and to facilitate access to government grants and support for housing reconstruction.

The second community includes two settlements; Dihi and Phasimai of Jilu in Ward 4 of Bhimeshwor Municipality. Some 220 households were affected by the earthquake and most of them are still living in temporary shelters. Since most of them hold land titles, they plan to develop an integrated settlement plan as a part of their post-earthquake recovery. The project aims to support the community to implement participatory and inclusive land re-adjustment process and issuance of new titles in accordance with the approved integrated settlement plan. This support will also facilitate access by the community to government grants.

The third community is composed of two settlements previously located in the slopes of a mountain of Laplang and Suspa Chhemawati, and were displaced by a landslide. About 84 households were temporarily settled in a public land located in Pani Pokhari of Ward No 8, Bhimeshwor Municipality and need to be permanently resettled. The government has recently agreed to permanently resettle the affected communities in their current location through a land swapping scheme. These project interventions will necessitate the development of an integrated plan in the relocation site and to efficiently undertake the land swapping scheme between their previous landholdings and the relocation site. A request for support in the fourth site regarding the relocation and integrated settlement planning of Bulungkhani of Bigu Municipality will also considered after further field assessment.

The project partners agreed to potentially use and apply some of the GLTN tools in an integrated manner like the participatory enumeration, Social Tenure Domain Model, Tenure -responsive Land Use Planning, Gender Evaluation Criteria and Participatory and Inclusive Land Re-Adjustment (PILaR). These tools will be modified and will be customized accordingly to suit the local context. The experience of these interventions, which will be driven mainly by HURADEC and local community members, will also inform possible changes in the current policies and regulations. Meanwhile, at national level, it will also provide feedback in the development of a responsive National Land Policy and Fit-For-Purpose Land Administration strategy being undertaken in close collaboration with national government authorities, key land actors and Community Self-Reliance Centre (CSRC), an NGO affiliated with International Land Coalition.",Fit-for-Purpose Land Administration Initiative in Nepal Kicks Off,publish,fit-for-purpose-land-administration-initiative-in-nepal-kicks-off,5/29/2017 15:45

The overall purpose of the programme was to share on the current reform initiatives being undertaken in Nepal including land policy development post- earthquake disaster and the promulgation of the Constitution in 2015 and to discuss on the different innovative land tools and approaches on Fit for Purpose Land Administration (FFPLA) to implement them.

The programme draw on a wide range of national and international expertise and achieved learning through practical examples of successful application of the tools mainly in Nepal and elsewhere. There were altogether 86 participants among which 24% were female. The participants represented 40 different organizations which included different government, non-government, INGOs and academic institutions in Nepal.

The discussions focused in relation to Global Land Tool Network (GLTN) tools and approaches and the context of country level engagement in Nepal highlighted by Mr Danilo Antonio from UN-Habitat, Nairobi. The presentation on Good Land Governance, International Framework for Pro-poor Gender sensitive Land Policy and Fit For Purpose Land Administration from FIG Honorary President Prof Stig Enemark gave the insight on these concepts and approaches and how they work. Mr Kamal Ghimire from National Reconstruction shared the land and tenure issues in post-earthquake recovery and how they are being dealt to provide land tenure security to construct a house for each earthquake victim. Mr Goapl Giri from MoALMC highlighted on the key features of the draft national land policy which has a base on the Continuum principles to addressing to the security of different existing land tenure types in Nepal. A Fit For Purpose Land Administration strategy for the implementation of proposed national land policy was also shared in the learning exchange.

The programme provided a platform for lively and open communication between the stakeholders and the concerned Government organizations. The feedback and inputs provided will help to promote and implement appropriate land policies, tools and approaches that are pro-poor, gender responsive, effective and sustainable in the post-Constitution and post-earthquake recovery context. The interest of GLTN in Nepal and the commitment of government to work on fit for purpose and a pro-poor gender responsive land administration was strengthened and this “National Land Forum” indicate a good momentum for all to work together in the future and an incentive for additional inputs for country level engagements.

</ul>
July has been a month of important achievements for the sanitation sector in Nepal. On 3 July 2018, with the presence of Ms. Ramkumari Chaudhary, State Minister of the Agriculture, Land Reform and Cooperative Ministry, Sunsari District was declared open defecation free (ODF).

On 12 July 2018, Nuwakot district gained the same status. The declaration programme was chaired by the District Coordination Committee (DCC) Chairperson, Mr. Santaman Tamang and the Honourable Member of Parliament, Mr. Bahadur Singh Lama as the chief guest of the ceremony. A welcome speech from the Deputy Chairperson of District WASH Coordination Committee (D-WASH-CC), Ms. Apsara Thapa, opened the event followed by the highlights of the process achieved reported by Mr Mohan Lal Jaisi, a D-WASH-CC Member Secretary.
During the ceremonies, hygiene and sanitation awareness songs, cultural dances and traditional folk music were presented. Festivities revolved around dancing to the tune of sanitation and hygiene.
<div>Ms. Sudha Shrestha, Acting Chief Technical Advisor and GSF Programme Manager at UN-Habitat, Nepal.
Ms. Sudha Shrestha, Acting Chief Technical Advisor and GSF Programme Manager at the United Nations Human Settlement Program (UN-Habitat), shared her joy, noting how “despite our greatest challenge of social acceptance and continued open defecation, the local government’s leadership alongside our development partners and communities’ ownership is what paved the way to its success.”</div>
<div>In Nuwakot, Mr. Bahadur Singh Lama made a special mention to sanitation triggerers and women for their active leadership role to achieve the result and made a similar statement: ”We have to work sincerely on total sanitation as the responsibility has been bestowed upon us for the days to come.”</div>
<div>Nuwakot village is one of 14 districts most affected by the earthquakes in 2015. From a zero-subsidy approach, the Government, with the support of local NGOs and donor agencies, alongside the active role of the WASH sector and the community, led to the district’s official status of ODF. It is part of a national campaign to persuade people to use toilets and improve sanitation and cleanliness. The Government has shown a unanimous political unity on this front. Additionallly, community groups and schools have been very active in the development of the campaign.</div>
<div>Sunsari, located in the country’s eastern Terai region, is one of the biggest economic hubs of Nepal. Bordering India, it has better access to transportation, education and other facilities compared to other districts. Therefore, achieving a cleaner and healthier environment through a focus on eliminating open defecation would not only greatly impact the community’s safety and dignity, but would also have positive economic effects. Sunsari’s history in receiving support to its sanitation practices goes back to 1980, when various development partners and international non-governmental organisations attempted to improve the situation. However, past efforts to address the problem had little success.</div>
<div></div>
<div>WSSCC has been involved in the process after the earthquakes in July 2015. The Global Sanitation Fund has been providing support, by giving priority to educational initiatives about hygiene and sanitation. Through plays, poetry, singing and dancing, the ‘triggering’ process was piloted in the area where villagers have been educated about good sanitation and hygiene practices as well as the construction of toilets.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sunsari and Nuwakot are now the role models for the joint efforts of international actors, local communities, institutions and district level stakeholders coming together, working towards ODF targets. The importance of proper sanitation and hygiene more often than not gets overlooked, however, improving this sector with as simple as quality access to facilities like a toilet helps people build a life filled with pride and dignity.</div>

3119,9/1/2018 11:37,"<strong>30 August 2018, Lalitpur</strong> 2015 April earthquake caused unprecedented damage to the lives and properties of thousands of people in Nepal. In the Kathmandu Valley, the damage was extensive in the old settlements. Not only did the people lose their houses, many lost their lives and their means of livelihood as well. Bungamati was no different. Nearly 800 houses were damaged; the lost entrepreneurs and traditional craftsmanship saw a major setback during the time. With an aim to revive this, once a very vibrant old town, EU and UN Habitat supported project “Sustainable Tourism and Green Growth for the Heritage Settlements of Kathmandu Valley” was initiated for this purpose. The project aims to build the capacity of the local community to lead the process. As part of the project, the cluster committees were formed at the community level. The municipality has demarked the boundary of heritage and the community within this boundary is divided into 12 clusters. The role of these cluster committees is to unify and mobilize the fellow community members in order to, identify issues existing in their cluster, strategize various plans to address these issues, develop different development plans and initiatives to improve the condition of the community clusters. In order for the cluster committees to take up this noble initiative, their capacity needs to be built. Therefore, this training workshop was planned. The two days workshop focused in facilitating the process of developing community action plan for each community.

To assist them to prepare strategy and plan for development of their cluster, Mr. Prafulla Man Singha Pradhan, senior advisor to Lalitpur Metropolitan City, UN Habitat and Lumanti was the facilitator of the workshop. The first day focused on briefing the representatives about the objectives and the activities planned under the project-Bungamati-Pilachenn-PARYA Sampada. Mr. Padam Sunder Joshi, Habitat Program Manager of UN Habitat, welcomed the participants and gave a brief about the idea behind the development of the project. Bungamati with its rich social and cultural aspects has a potential to be revitalized and developed a touristic center showcasing the history and culture of the Newari Society.

The three implementing partners, CUID, SABAH and Lumanti presented the scope of their work in project, which was followed by interaction with the participants. The second session of the first day concentrated on making the cluster committee understand their role in developing a planning process in their clusters so that they are able to find additional resources besides the project for the physical, cultural and social improvement of their clusters. The cluster committees were asked to identify the strong points, weak points, opportunities and challenges in clusters and ways to mitigate were also discussed. The activities on second day were more focused on preparing the action plan by each cluster committee to work out the process to address the aspects discussed on the first day. Each team prepared a very comprehensive and detailed plan of the actions they would take to implement the project they had prioritized and had also identified prospective stakeholders with whom they would partner for the implementation. Each group work was followed by presentation from the cluster team to the other cluster representatives so that they could learn from each other. The process helped the clusters team to have a clear goal as to how they want to move forward. The sheets prepared by the clusters have been finalized and will be shared with the team. The program was closed by Ms. Lajana Manandhar, Executive Director of LUMANTI. She stressed that there is a genuine need to preserve out cultural heritage and the community should take a lead on that. They should not depend fully on outside resources but build it in with their own capacity and the project and its partners were there to support them through various capacity development program. The participants also appreciated the process and have committed continue the process and share the outcome of the workshop with their fellow community members.",Training Workshop on Community-led Development Process and Strategy Planning for Bungamati Area Reconstruction and Development Committee,publish,training-workshop-on-community-led-development-process-and-strategy-planning-for-bungamati-area-reconstruction-and-development-committee,11/30/2018 11:40

Though it is a natural process, but society has made some restriction/discrimination to women and those discrimination and restriction are different depending upon the community, geographical region, caste, religion etc. so, it is necessary to break the conservative thinking, behavior and practice. Until and unless we join hands together and committed to eliminate these social restriction/discriminations which are based on conservative belief and taboos, women could not be empowered. These types of social belief has played as a major huddle for women empowerment and progress. So, considering all these bitter reality, for the first time, government of Nepal had made plan to celebrate the Menstrual Hygiene Management day with the slogan “No More Limits” to create more awareness on these issues i.e. discrimination/restriction. Government of Nepal localized this theme as “National Dignified Menstruation Day 2075”

On the contrary, 11 VDCs of the district that lie in Rajapur Tappa (Island), are remote and isolated from the district headquarter and rest of the country as it is confined by the Karnali River in two sides,. This unfavorable location coupled with low socio- economic condition of the communities and underdevelopment within does not deter the construction ofaround 3000 new toilets . It was possible because of the awareness campaign, facilitated by IDS Nepal in support of the GSF program, which triggers communities to use and maintain improved latrines and inculcate hygiene practices.

Sense of ownership and accountability among local stakeholders such as V-WASH-CCs, School teachers and Child Clubs, Ward Citizen Forums, Political leaders, Badghars and FCHVs has been growing up rapidly. As a result, a number of wards are lining up to get ODF declaration in upcoming days. Ownership building at the smallest local administrative unit as wards is certainly going to yield long term sustainability ensuring bottom up planning and institutionalization. At the same time because of this campaign, sense of collective participation and efforts has been developing among communities for other social welfare activities too.

सामान्यतया प्रायः मानिसले बिहान उठ्नसाथ नित्य कर्म मध्ये चर्पीको प्रयोग नै पहिले गर्दछ।WSSCC का अनुसार औसतमा मानिसले वर्षमा २५ सय पटक चर्पीको प्रयोग गर्दछ। विश्वका अझैपनि २.६ अर्ब जनसंख्या खुलाठाउँमा दिसा गर्न बाध्य छन्। दिसा पिसाबको लागि सँधै चर्पीको प्रयोग गर्नु अत्यन्तै सभ्य र महत्त्वपूर्ण बानी हो जसबाट हामी विभिन्न सरूवा रोगहरूबाट बच्न सक्छौँ। यस वर्षको विश्व शौचालय दिवस यही मंसीर ३ (अर्थात नोभेम्बर १९) का दिन विश्वभर विभिन्न कार्यक्रमका साथ मनाईंदै छ। दीगो विकासको लक्ष्य एजेन्डा ६ः२ ले सन् २०३० सम्ममा सबैका लागि पर्याप्त सरसफाइ र स्वच्छतामा समतामूलक पहुँच हासिल गर्ने र खुला दिसा गर्ने अभ्यासको अन्त्य गर्ने लक्ष्य राखेको छ। यस क्रममा, महिला, बालिका, किशोरी तथा अन्य संकटासन्न अवस्थामा रहेकाहरूको आवश्यकतालाई विशेष ध्यान दिनुपर्ने वताएको छ।

तुलनात्मक रूपमा हेर्दा नेपालमा चर्पी निर्माणमा राम्रै प्रगति भएको देखिन्छ। आज भन्दा ३७ वर्षअघि अर्थात सन् १९८० मा नेपालमा २ प्रतिशत जनताको घरमा मात्रै चर्पीको सुविधा थियो। सन् १९८० मा ६ प्रतिशत, सन् २००० मा ३० प्रतिशत र सन् २०१७ मा आइपुग्दा नेपालका ९३ प्रतिशत जनताको घरमा चर्पी निर्माण भइसकेको सरकारी तथ्यांक छ।

नेपालमा २०७४ श्रावण ३० गतेसम्मको तथ्याङ्क हेर्दा करिब ९३ प्रतिशत नेपालीको घरमा चर्पीको सुविधा पुगिसकेको छ। २०६८ को जनगणना अनुसार नेपालभर जम्मा ५५ लाख २२ हजार ५ सय ३१ घरधुरी छन्। यी मध्ये करिव ५२ लाख भन्दा बढी जनसंख्याले चर्पी निर्माण गरिसकेका छन्। सरकारी तथ्याङ्क अनुसार अब जम्मा ३ लाख ६८ हजार ४ सय ९९ घरमा चर्पी बनाउन बाँकी छ। नेपाल सरकारले सन् २०१७ सम्म सम्पूर्ण नेपालीको घरमा चर्पीको आधारभूत सुविधा पुर्याउने लक्ष्य लिएको थियो। अब करिब डेढ महिना मात्र बाँकी छ। के हामी करिव ४५ दिनभित्र बाँकी ७ प्रतिशत चर्पी निर्माण गर्न सक्छौं त? यो प्रश्नको उत्तर भने नमिठो छ।

शहरी विकास मन्त्रालयका प्रवक्ता एवं सहसचिव शंकरप्रसाद सुवेदीले भने, ‘हामीले सन् २०१७ भित्र सबै नेपालीको घरमा चर्पीको सुविधा पुर्याउने राष्ट्रिय लक्ष्य पूरा गर्न नसक्ने भयौँ। किनकी अब करिब बाँकी ४५ दिनभित्र ३ लाख भन्दा बढी चर्पी बनाउन सकिंँदैन। यो लक्ष्य पूरा गर्न नसक्नुमा हाम्रो मेहनत नपुगेकै हो। भूकम्पका कारणमात्र ३ लाख भन्दा बढी चर्पी ध्वस्त भए। सरसफाइका लागि पर्याप्त वजेटको उपलब्धता हुन सकिरहेको छैन। साथै छिमेकी मुलुकले जनतालाई शौचालयमा अनुदान दिएको छ तर हामीले जनतालाई आर्थिक रुपमा सहयोग गरेका छैनौं। वास्तवमा अझैपनि जनताले शौचालयमा अनुदानको केही अपेक्षा गरेका छन्।’ नेपालको सन्दर्भमा शौचालय निर्माण अभियानमा भएका त्रुटीहरूको सम्बन्धीत निकायले छानविन गर्नुपर्ने उहाँले बताउनुभयो। सरकारले लिएका सबै लक्ष्य कहाँ पुरा हुन्छन् र? सरोकारवालाबीच राम्रो संयोजन हुन नसक्दा, प्राकृतिक विपत्ती र राजनितिक गतिविधि तथा आवधिक निर्वाचनका कारण सरसफाईको राष्ट्रिय लक्ष्य प्राप्ती गर्न नसकिएको हो। यस विषयमा अझ हाम्रो कमजोरी कहाँ रह्यो भनेर हामी समीक्षा गर्नेछौँ। मन्त्रालयले सम्बद्ध सबै मन्त्रालय, विभाग र साझेदार तथा सरोकारवालाहरुसँग व्यपाक छलफल गरी, कार्यायोजना बनाई सन् २०१७ को डिसेम्बरको अन्तसम्ममा शत् प्रतिशत लक्ष्य प्राप्त गर्ने अर्को नयाँ मिति तय गर्नेछ, सुवेदीले भने।

शौचालय निर्माणका लागि आर्थिक सहयोग नगर्ने रणनीति सरकारको छ। आफ्नो चर्पी बनाउन सरकार तथा संस्थाको भर नपर्न सरकारले भनेको छ तर चर्पी निर्माणबारे जनतामा सचेतना फैलाउने, जागरण ल्याउने, तथा सोच र व्यवहार परिवर्तन गरी चर्पी निर्माण गर्न तयार पार्ने शिर्षकमा धेरै पैसा सकिएको छ। केही संस्थाहरुले चर्पी निर्माण अभियानका लागि जनतामा जागरण ल्याउने भन्दै होटलका गोष्ठी, तालिम, निरीक्षण, अनुगमन, घरदैलो कार्यक्रम लगायतका विभिन्न शिर्षकमा पैसा खर्च गरेका छन्। जसबाट जनता प्रत्यक्ष रुपमा धेरैे लाभान्वित हुन सकेका छैनन्। यसको पनि मुल्यांकन हुन जरुरी छ।
वास्तवमा केन्द्रीय स्तरमा सरसफाइमा कार्यरत सरकारी संयन्त्र तथा सरोकारवालाबीच निर्णय राम्रा हुने गरेका छन्। तर जिल्लास्तर तथा गाउँस्तरमा कार्यान्वयन अझ प्रभावकारी हुन सकेको छैन। स्थानीय स्तरमा स्रोतको अभाव छ। समयमै वजेट निकासा हुन नसक्नु जस्ता आर्थिक समस्याहरुले पनि उत्तिकै प्रभाव पारेको छ। भुकम्पका कारण ३ लाख भन्दा बढी चर्पीहरू समेत ध्वस्त भएका छन्। तसर्थ भुकम्प प्रभावित जिल्लामा विशेष कार्यक्रमका साथ चर्पी निर्माण अभियान संचालन गर्नुपर्ने आवश्यकता छ।

हालसम्म जम्मा ५१ जिल्लाका मात्रै सबै घरमा शौचालय बनिसकेका छन्। जानकारहरूका अनुसार अझैपनि १४ जिल्लामा चर्पी निर्माणलाई तीव्रता दिन निकै कठिन छ। भूकम्प, अघोषित नाकाबन्दी, घर पुनःनिर्माण, तराईमा आएको बाढीको प्रकोप, स्थानीय निर्वाचन र आउँदै गरेको प्रदेश–सभाको तथा संसदीय निर्वाचनका कारण चर्पी निर्माणको गति प्रभावित वनेको छ र केही सुस्तता छाएको छ। स्थानीय निर्वाचित जनप्रतिनिधीहरूको ध्यान यस कुरामा खासै पर्न सकिरहेको छैन। केही गैरसरकारी संस्थामा कार्यरत सामाजिक अभियन्ताको अप्रत्यक्ष दवाव, घरदैलो कार्यक्रमले मात्र शौचालय निर्माण कार्यमा तीव्रता दिन कठिन हुन्छ। स्थानीय तहको पुर्नसंरचनापछि त झनै पुरै गाउँपालिकालाई नै खुला दिसामुक्त क्षेत्र घोषणा गर्न चुनौती छ। सरकार जनतालाई जसरी भए पनि चर्पी बनाउन र एक रुपैँया अनुदानको पनि अपेक्षा नगर्न आग्रह गर्छ। गैरसरकारी संस्थाहरूले जनतालाई प्रत्यक्ष फाइदापुग्ने भन्दापनि कर्मकाण्डी तालिम, गोष्ठी, अनुगमन, सभा सम्मेलनमा पैसा बढी खर्च गरीरहेको स्थानीय नेतृत्वको आरोप तथा गुनासो छ।
वास्तवमा सरसफाइलाई सामाजिक क्रान्तिका रुपमा लिनुपर्छ। किनकी सरसफाई विकासका लागि, स्वस्थ जीवनका लागि र व्यक्तिगत तथा राष्ट्रिय प्रतिष्ठिाको विषय हो। तसर्थ सन् २०१७ भित्र किन हामीले ७ प्रतिशत जनताको घरमा चर्पी बनाउन नसक्ने भयौँ? यसको विश्लेषण सम्बद्ध सरकारी निकाय, विकासका साझेदारहरु तथा सरोकारवालाहरूले गम्भीर भएर गर्नैैपर्छ। जनशक्ति व्यवस्थापन, आपसी समन्वय र जनताप्रति समर्पित भावले अझ प्रभावकारी ढंगले लागि परेर तोकिएको समयमा सबै नेपालीका घरमा कम्तीमा शौचालयको आधारभूत सुविधा पुर्याउने कार्यमा तन–मन–वचन र सत्कर्मले अघि बढ्न जरूरी छ।",किन पुरा  भएन २०१७ भित्र सबै नेपालीको घरमा चर्पी पुर्‍याउने राष्ट्रिय लक्ष्य?,publish,%e0%a4%95%e0%a4%bf%e0%a4%a8-%e0%a4%aa%e0%a5%81%e0%a4%b0%e0%a4%be-%e0%a4%ad%e0%a4%8f%e0%a4%a8-%e0%a5%a8%e0%a5%a6%e0%a5%a7%e0%a5%ad-%e0%a4%ad%e0%a4%bf%e0%a4%a4%e0%a5%8d%e0%a4%b0-%e0%a4%b8%e0%a4%ac,4/5/2019 17:21

With Saptari expected to be an Open Defecation Free zone by the end of 2017, more than 21 households are yet to build latrines — a basic requisite as per the campaign rules — in their homes .

As per data from the district’s water and sanitation division, of the total 118,563, over 97,701 households now have latrines. In the VDC-wise data, of the total 91 VDCs, only 42 have so far been declared ODF zones.

According to office chief Lokendra Kumar Yadav, the situation is bleak in places like in Jhutki, Sakarpura, Launiyan, Inaruwa and Tarahi, where a mere 21 per cent of houses are equipped with latrines.

The situation looks grim at the district headquarters, which has not yet attained the ODF status. While a public toilet was demolished to construct a temple, two newly constructed latrines are yet to be used. This leaves the public no choice but to defecate in the open, say locals of the district.

Rajbiraj Municipality is preparing to launch various programmes to support the ODF campaign. Remaining municipalities — Saptakoshi, Shambhunath, Hanumannagar, Yogini Mai and Kanchanrup — are faring no better.

On his part, Federation of Non-government Organisation Chairperson Shambhanand Chaudhary attributed the sad performance of the ODF campaign to financial and social factors. “As the population in the district is impoverished and landless, it has hampered the ODF campaign,” he said.

Jhapa’s Kankai Municipality was been declared open defecation free zone today. The declaration coincided with the National Democracy Day celebrations today.

Kankai is the first municipality to be declared an ODF zone in Jhapa.

Out of 8 municipalities and 7 rural municipalities, only two rural municipalities have been declared ODF zones in the district. On the eve of the declaration, candles were lit.

Birat Community Study Centre had facilitated the ODF campaign with support from Global Sanitation Fund Programme in the municipality.

Kankai Municipality Mayor Rajendra Pokhrel said they had a plan to build similar looking houses, and plant the same kind of trees in the municipality. Pokhrel said they would take action if anyone was found defecating in the open.

Any individual, organisation and firm defying the rule will be blacklisted.

A person found defecating in the open for the first time will be fined Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 will be charged in case the person is caught the next time.

<strong>BAJURA, March 4 2016</strong>: Women of Bajura district have started focusing on sanitation issues apart from their conventional household chores.

The activists from the Women Rights Forum of Bajura have started the sanitation drive after people started getting sick from the open defecation in the district.

Bajura was declared the 16<sup>th</sup> open defecation free (ODF) district on November 18, 2014.

In the year 2011/12, only 10.53 per cent of houses had toilets; but in a short time, 100 per cent houses built toilets through support of GSF making it an ODF district.

Sanitation drive coordinator Janak Bhatta has attributed the change to the great efforts from the women of the district.

For example, contributions of Rithu Sarki of Trapa, Brahmatola-3 have inspired the drive not only in the VDC, but also in the district, he added.

Sarki is a single woman, whose husband Naulo Sarki died five years ago in course of a job in Delhi. She has a hard time to live hand-to-mouth and earn through agriculture, but has inspired many others in the village.

They have also established a trust for the drive in which women deposit Rs 20 each for the cause, informed Devika Shah, another activist.

After the district was declared ODF zone, they aim to involve all people in the cleanliness drive within next 10 years.

They aim to install toilets in every house, clean houses, fix proper garbage disposal areas among others to achieve the same in 40 houses of the village under women’s supervision, according to the activists.

<em>Having worked in the sanitation sector, mainly in the Open Defection Free (ODF) campaign, for a long time, MADAN KUMAR MALLA, monitoring and evaluation specialist at UN Habitat, knows the many lapses and strengths of the program. As Nepal is close to the end of 2017, Malla spoke to New Spotlight on various issues, including the state of ODF in Nepal. Excerpts:</em>

<b>As we are close to the end of the year 2017, how do you see the possibility of making Nepal an Open Defection Free country?</b>

Despite major floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters, Nepal has performed well towards becoming ODF. We cannot achieve sanitation for all this year, but we are close to achieving it. The last floods have badly affected our achievements. We covered 84 percent with our sanitation program in Rautahat, but the floods badly hurt the campaign. The situation is the same in 15 districts. Given the present pace, what I can say is that we will cover over 93.3 per cent. We are working hard to achieve it. We can achieve up to 98 percent sanitation.

<b>How did the 2017 flood affect the campaign to provide toilets?</b>

Although the reports of all flood affected districts are not available, from the preliminary estimates, it is found that a total of 26,499 toilets were fully and partially damaged in 15 Terai districts. The highest damage was in Morang (6,236) while the lowest was in Jhapa (20). Two ODF declared districts namely Bardia (6,137) and Dang (550) were hard hit by the floods and there was a high damage of toilets- 6,137 and 550 toilets respectively.

<b>How did the restructuring of the local bodies affect the ODF campaign?</b>

Although new restructuring drive has generated a small confusion, the drive has not disturbed our sanitation process. It has rather made it easier for use to work. There were many local bodies before the local restructuring. Now the number has come down. There were many municipalities and village development committees earlier. Now, as the numbers have gone down, we find it easier to work.

<b>As the country is close to achieving ODF, experts are also raising questions about fecal management. How do you look at this?</b>

It is a technical issue. We are now constructing two-pit toilets, one part with water and the other with fecal. Fecal management is not a problem in hill areas. However, this is a problem in terai where water table is high and frequent flood creates problems. In the initial phase, we built most of the toilets with a single pit because we had declared to achieve sanitation for all by 2017 with limited resources and time. With an aim to achieve the target, we ignored the fecal management issue in construction of toilets in the initial phase. However, now, we are incorporating the technical side for fecal management as well.

<b>With less than a month for 2017 to end, how do you sum up the progress in ODF campaign?</b>

As I told you we are very close to achieving the target.  Had the floods not disrupted our work, Nepal would have been in a position to achieve the goal. Our sanitation coverage now is 93.7 percent. As Nepal is in the process of holding the elections, I cannot claim that Nepal will achieve 100 percent target soon, but we can achieve 98 percent. I think we are still close to our target.

<b>There is low progress in Terai compared to other areas. Is it related to money?</b>

All the eight districts of terai are high earners of remittance and there is enough money. Money has nothing to do with the low number of toilets. People are not building toilets because of their attitudes. Although poor people live in some places, it is the rich who don’t want to build the toilets. In many areas, people are unable to build the toilet because landowners do not allow tillers to do so. We are addressing it by building community toilets and public toilets.

<b>How do you see the state of public toilets?</b>

This is a real problem. This is not only in Terai but also a problem of urban areas like Kathmandu. There is the need to have public toilets and community toilets to achieve the universal sanitation coverage.

<b>At a time when we are working to make 100 per cent sanitation coverage, how do you see the progress in hand-washing?</b>

Hand washing is one of the important components of sanitation. Hand washing with soap alone can reduce 44 percent Diarrhea incidence. Sanitation (safe toilets) reduces 32 percent and PoU treatment of drinking water reduces 39 percent. Source water treatment reduces 11 percent. Hand washing with soap, combined with treated water and sanitation can stop the diarrhea nearly 100 percent. It controls the diathermia disease.

<b>What are other contributions?</b>

As I mentioned proper hand washing with soap can reduce diarrheal death of children under 5 by nearly 50 percent. According to a study, it saves globally 525000 deaths a year.

Hand washing can reduce nearly 50 percent ARI (acute respiratory infections) in children. It considerably reduces the intestinal worm infections. It considerably reduces the Skin and Eye infections. Hand washing is vaccination against many diseases.

<b>What is the current situation in Nepal?</b>

No authentic data base is available, but the situation is not very encouraging. Nepalese are habitual to wash hands with plain water. Hand washing with soap is increasing as a trend. Percentage of hand washing with proper hand washing facilities is quite low or merely 20 percent. However, eighty percent of schools are reported to have hand washing facilities. But, many schools have severe water shortage.  It is a fact that hand washing facilities in public places are rare.

<b>What are the initiatives taken so far?</b>

Some initiatives have already been taken, like various programs have already been organized to make hand washing a habit. Focused programs to wash hands in critical times like Aghi tin, Pachhi tin (Three initially and later three) has already been introduced. Hand washing with soap is one of the major activities in Total Sanitation Campaign. Many Governments and Non Government institutions are working in hand washing campaigns.

<b>How do you see the achievements?</b>

So far as our achievement is concerned, there are 42 ODF Declared Districts, District with 100% coverage- 7, District with over 90 percent coverage 11, district with 80-90 percent coverage- 10 and District with over 80 percent coverage 5.

<b>How do you see the state of sanitation in terms of new local levels?</b>

Gaupalika 330 out of 460, 330 Gaupalika and out of 293 Municipality 164 have already been declared ODF. Toilet coverage has increased in all the provinces. Out of 7 provinces, No 4 and 6 provinces have 100 percent coverage. Out of 77 districts, 41 districts are declared ODF. Since 1990 till now, Nepal has made 94 percent success.  In terms of provinces, No. 1 province has 97.5 percent, No. 2 province 78.5, No. 3 provinces 93, No. 4 province 100, No. 5 province 97.75, No. 6 province 100 and No. 7 province 99.85.

<b>Which districts are most challenging?</b>

Eight districts of No. 2 province are most challenging. The toilet coverage in the district includes: Parsa 80 percent, Rautahat 84.1 percent, Bara 65 percent, Sarlahi 70 percent, Saptari 87 percent, Siraha 87 percent, Dhanusha 77 percent and Mahottarai 75 percent.

3180,3/28/2019 12:11,"28 March 2019: The Government Spokesperson, the Honorable Minister Mr Gokul Prasad Baskota, has announced the new National Land Policy 2019 as approved by the Government of Nepal. This is an enormous step forward for Nepal on land policy. It is also a credit to GLTN and all its Partners for their hard work.
<p style=""text-align: left;"">As the Joint Secretary and Spokesperson from the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, Government of Nepal, Mr Janak Raj Joshi said, “It is a great achievement and is considered to be a milestone to address the long-awaited problems such as recognition of informal tenure and equitable access to land for landless, small holders and informal settlers in the Nepalese society. This policy will support to achieve the national goal of sustainable development through good land governance”.</p>
The Land policy represents several years of hard work and extensive consultations with experts, community people and other stakeholders. There was much anticipation when the Minister of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, the Honorable Ms Padma Kumari Aryal, submitted the draft land policy to the Nepalese Cabinet of Ministers for approval, followed by relief and excitement when the Cabinet approved the new Land Policy.

Nepal’s National Land Policy comes at a time of recovery and reconstruction. The country is implementing a federal governance restructuring programme and recovering from a decade long armed conflict (1996-2006). Parts of Nepal are still struggling to recover and re-build after the devastating 2015 earthquake, which affected millions of Nepalese citizens and destroyed nearly one million homes.

Using the 2015 Constitution to strengthen development and ensure that consideration is given to key global and regional frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests (VGGTs) and the New Urban Agenda (NUA), the National Land Policy is considered a strong step forward for Nepal on good land governance.

<span lang=""EN-US"">First, it is intended to directly address the issue of land administration and land management reforms under six major and key pillar objectives:</span>
<ol>
 	<li>Security of tenure,</li>
 	<li>Access to land,</li>
 	<li>Land Use,</li>
 	<li>Land Valuation, taxation and land market,</li>
 	<li>Land acquisition, and</li>
 	<li>Modernization of land administration services.</li>
</ol>
<span lang=""EN-US"">Secondly, it is underpinned by a strong inclusive agenda that considers the issues affecting the land rights of women and vulnerable groups. This includes:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span lang=""EN-US"">Rehabilitation of landless, squatters and informal tenure-holders for improved housing,</span></li>
 	<li><span lang=""EN-US""> </span><span lang=""EN-US"">Access to land and security of tenure,</span></li>
 	<li><span lang=""EN-US"">Tenure security for landless peasants for farming,</span></li>
 	<li><span lang=""EN-US"">Women’s access to land ownership, and</span></li>
 	<li><span lang=""EN-US"">The optimum use of land for sustainable housing</span></li>
</ol>
<span lang=""EN-US""> </span><span lang=""EN-US"">Third, the policy is forward looking and considers key environmental challenges related to food security, infrastructure development, and the application of Fit-For-Purpose techniques in land administration.</span>

In collaboration with GLTN, the UN-Habitat Nepal office and partner organization Community Self Reliance Centre (CSRC), the Government of Nepal and national experts drafted the policy and undertook the necessary studies on land and tenure issues to inform it.</span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">Over the last seven years, GLTN and partners have been heavily involved in sharing knowledge, building capacity on international best practices, and providing avenues for consultation and discussion with all key stakeholders in different provinces and municipalities. Numerous learning events held have been critical in the development of new, inclusive approaches to tenure security and land management, understanding various stakeholders’ needs, and ensuring a common understanding of the policy’s scope. </span>

<span lang=""EN-US"">There are a number of areas Nepal will now give attention to in order to implement the provisions of the National Land Policy:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span lang=""EN-US"">Dialogue and capacity building with multiple stakeholders at provincial and local levels on the benefits of the land policy.</span></li>
 	<li><span lang=""EN-US"">Capacity building on GLTN tools like the Fit-For-Purpose approach and how it can be used to address outstanding land administration challenges in line with federal restructuring.</span></li>
 	<li><span lang=""EN-US"">Identification, Verification and Recordation (IVR) of informal tenure-holders covering approximately 25% of arable land.</span></li>
 	<li><span lang=""EN-US"">Amendment and enactment of land legislation at the federal, provincial and local levels in line with the provisions of the new land policy.</span></li>
 	<li><span lang=""EN-US"">Training and implementation of Land Use Planning at the municipal levels.</span></li>
 	<li><span lang=""EN-US"">Collaboration with national agencies, development partners and civil society organizations to fill the financial and technical gaps required to implement the policy. </span></li>
</ol>
<span lang=""EN-US"">In many of these forthcoming endeavors, Nepal will still benefit from the GLTN tools and knowledge.

3184,1/28/2019 12:24,"The issue of access to land for the landless, land tenure security and sustainable land management has been a priority area not only for the Nepal government but also for international bodies. Ratnanagar, a small municipality in Chitwan district, Province No 3 in Nepal has an estimated population of 90,000 and about 25 to 30 small and large informal settlement sites. Some of the settlements are recent while many have existed for several decades. A Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) conducted in August 2018 by UN-Habitat together with the municipal officials indicates that they constitute about 8% to 10% of total Households (HHs) within the municipality. Therefore, the municipality has always been keen on developing an information system for these informal settlements.

To respond to this need and as part of the Global Land Tool Network (GLTN) support to land reform initiatives in Nepal, UN-Habitat in partnership with a local NGO Lumanti Support Group For Shelter has been supporting Ratnanagar Municipality in developing an informal land information system. Hence, UN-Habitat and Ratnanagar Municipality have had several discussions on developing an information system to identify and analyze person and group land tenure relationships. This data will enable the municipality and concerned bodies to make informed decisions on tenure security and form a solid base for municipal planning. The information system will be based on the open source GLTN land tool, the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) which will be used for identification, verification and recordation of informal tenure holders in the municipality. The system will also be used to analyse data, generate information for land management and tenure security, document lessons learnt and provide recommendations for other Municipalities in Nepal.

To kick off, a project inception workshop was held on 21 December 2018 in Ratnanagar brought together 44 participants, 30% of whom were female. This marked the official launch of the project led by Mayor Mr. Narayan Ban, UN-Habitat Programme Manager Mr. Padma Sunder Joshi and General Secretary of Lumanti Dr. Anita Manandhar. All three signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on how to conduct the project and its importance.

They also expressed their commitment to the success of the project. Municipality officials, elected leaders and representatives of local informal tenure holders participated in the discussions while Mr. Raja Ram Chhatkuli of UN-Habitat presented the objectives, methodology and anticipated results of the project. The project is scheduled to be completed by June 2019.

The land policy under discussion in Nepal, commits to recognize all types of land tenure and respect ownership of land. In line with this, <a href=""https://gltn.net/download/full-report-fit-for-purpose-land-administration-a-country-level-implementation-strategy-for-nepal/"">the Fit-For-Purpose Land Administration Country Level Strategy for Nepal</a> published in May 2018 advised for testing in at least one municipality on the appropriateness of data acquisition and processing of informal tenure using the <a href=""https://gltn.net/download/fit-for-purpose-land-administration-guiding-principles-for-country-implementation/"">Fit-For-Purpose (FFP) approach</a>. Thus, this project was recommended as a response.

Bungamati has been a synonym of wood carving from last few decades. Most of the creative wooden sculptures placed on rafters and struts of the heritages building are connected with this settlement. This is the most adapted family run business which has now boomed as most favorable tourism based enterprises. The creativity, the skills, the patience and the techniques required to excel in the business need to be applauded.
Engaged in the wood carving from early age, she is assisting her husband in this cottage industry. Woman sitting on the side, her contribution was limited to petty works like fabricating minor photo frames only. As the society sees it as ""men's job"" she lacked experience, opportunity and motivation to lead. Moreover, she lacked business idea that gives her strength and courage to establish her as a creative woodcarving professional.
Ms. Shakya, as described by her husband, is very creative and has an attitude to be someone different. She always wanted to move above this simple photo-frame making task and do something creative in which she can reflect herself. She took the opportunity to be a part of the “Wood Carving Training” which was organized by SABAH Nepal, under the project “Sustainable Tourism and Green Growth for Heritage Settlements of Kathmandu Valley” funded under Switch Asia programme by European Union. <img class=""wp-image-3201 alignright"" src=""http://unhabitat.org.np/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wood_craft_reg-1-224x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""193"" height=""258"" />
Her passion for the work and her creativity were clearly opening out during the two-month training assignments. She learnt the higher level of wood carving skills including complex design on the wooden door frames and wooden statues. With the project support she was the first women to register her business in the ward office. She is very excited and is planning to set up her own craft business outlet and start selling her own products to the domestic and international tourists visiting Bungamati",Creativity Galore – Wood Crafting,publish,creativity-galore-wood-crafting,6/19/2019 16:49

When she heard about the “Innovative Food Training” to improve the livelihood of people in Bungamati under the “Parya Sampada Project” she did not waste a second to get enrolled in the Yomari Moulding Training.
Yomari, a delicacy of the Newar community for specific events, is very popular cuisine in Kathmandu valley. It is a steamed dumpling that consists of moulded rice flour that is stuffed with molasses (Chaku). The delicacy plays very important role in Newar society. This dish is normally cooked on Yomari Punhi (the full moon day of November/December) to celebrate the rice harvesting. Yomari is also prepared for the birth day celebrations particularly of the children till age 12.

For this she attended five days yomari moulding training that was followed by additional seven days of on-the-job training at the Village Café Khokana. Trained Ganga Devi then joined “The Village Cage – Pulchowk”, an outlet of SABAH-Nepal, to make the yomari on the particular full-moon day of Yomari Punhi. She prepared around 150 yomaris on a single day and earned NPR 1,800 on that day. Encouraged with the income, she was determined to continue her skills that makes the customer satisfied and helps to conserve the intangible heritage of Newars. Excited with the success, Ganga Devi, together with her other participants of the training opened a food outlet in the “Lalit Trade Fair” organsied by Lalitpur Chamber of Commerce from 10-14 April, 2019. With the support of The Village Café the 'house-wives' were exposed to formal market outside their community that helped them to learn do's and dont's of the business.
Talking with her after the event, she was thrilled to share her first experience ever with the team that could carry out the business worth NPR 2,50,000 in five days. Now, she is committed to organise a group and to start the food business.

3282,1/29/2020 10:29,"As part of ongoing “<strong>Support to Land Reform Initiatives in Nepal</strong>” project, Land and Global Land Tool Network (GLTN) in collaboration with UN-Habitat Nepal Country Office, and its local partner Lumanti Support Group For Shelter, has completed the development of a Land Information Management System (LIMS) for tenure security in Ratnanagar Municipality.  The project which began in December 2018 aimed at establishing a functional LIMS based on the GLTN’s pro-poor, gender responsive, participatory and affordable land tool for capturing person/s to land relationships cognizant of the land rights continuum, the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM). The initiative is in line with the recently promulgated National Land Policy in Nepal which is underpinned by a strong inclusive agenda that considers the issues affecting security of tenure and land rights to all Nepalese citizens, including women and vulnerable groups. The policy also recognizes informal and customary tenure– as far as it is legitimate and socially accepted ensuring ‘nobody is left behind’.

During project implementation, UN-Habitat and GLTN provided technical support to the municipality and local partner Lumanti on the customization of the STDM to suit the land information requirements of the municipality. This involved the design and development of a questionnaire, data collection (socio-economic and spatial) of identified informal settlements and analysis of the same. Staff from the municipality were also trained on the use and application of the STDM to support the recordation and management of surveying and planning information. The LIMS currently has complete information on people-to-land relationships of all the 1,504 informal tenure households scattered in 53 large or small communities in the municipality, covering a population of about 7,007 people. The database indicates that out of the 1,504 households, approximately 93.4% are fully living on land without legal land documentation or land titles while about 6.6% have additional small pieces of land with titles or documentation. About 90.8% of households are living in small landholdings below 340 sq. m.

An information dissemination and handover ceremony was organized in November 2019 at the Ratnanagar Municipality where Mr. Raja Ram Chhatkuli of UN-Habitat handed over the new LIMS  to the Mayor of the Ratnanagar, Hon. Narayan Ban. In his remarks, Mr. Chhatkuli highlighted on the importance of land use management and land titling in light of the National Land Policy, and the recently passed Land Use Act, including the 7th and 8th Amendments to the existing Land Act. The 7th amendment provides for allotment of land to the landless Dalits and the 8th amendment, inter alia, provides for titling of Government land holdings under use for more than 10 years in the name of the respective informal tenure-holders, or their relocation to appropriate locations, if necessary. Hon. Ban appreciated the partner organizations, noting that Ratnanagar is the first Municipality in Nepal to have such a land information system. He added that the database would facilitate the provision of land documents to the informal tenure holders in due course and inform municipal planning and land management. Members of Provincial Legislature, Hon. Krishna Prasad Khanal and Hon. Kanchan Khanal emphasized the need of improving the land governance in Ratnanagar taking into consideration the much politization of the landless and informal tenure issues in the past. The initiative undertaken in Ratnanagar Municipality is a welcome example on this. The newly established land information management system will provide for the regularization of land tenure by providing conversion of legitimate and socially accepted rights into formal land rights.

The success of the Ratnanagar Municipality project has challenged other municipalities to undertake similar projects. GLTN is providing technical support to the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation of Government of Nepal and the respective Municipalities to implement similar projects in at least three other Municipalities- Belaka, Bharatpur and Kankai- in Nepal.

3312,2/27/2020 9:30,"Nepal has stepped into yet another and very important milestone in guaranteeing security of tenure and access to land for all. Following the promulgation of the new Constitution in September 2015, the Government of Nepal amended the Lands Act of 1964 through enacting a Lands (Seventh Amendment) Act in 2018 which provided a legal framework for implementation of Article 40 (5) of the Constitution on the provision of land to landless Dalits. This was endorsed in September 2018 and paved way for yet another Bill for an Eighth Amendment of the Land Act which proposed to allow ownership of land for “landless squatters” and “unmanaged dwellers”. After lengthy and hectic deliberations at the House Committee on Agriculture, Cooperatives and Natural Resources and both the Houses of the Parliament- the House of Representatives and the National Assembly-, the 8th Amendment Bill to the Land Act was passed on September 19, 2019.

The Land Act has finally come into force after the Presidential Seal was affixed on February 11, 2020. This is a joy to the 1.3 million landless, land poor and other families holding nearly 10 million parcels of land without formal recognition and under continued threat to eviction. This marks victory to both the tireless efforts of land rights champions in the country and the commitment of the Government of Nepal which has expressed in the motto ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’. The National Land Policy adopted by the Government of Nepal in March 2019 commits to securing tenure and land ownership, protection of land rights, rehabilitation of the landless, squatters and informal tenure-holders for improved housing, equitable access to land for all, including women and vulnerable groups. The Land Act will provide a legislative framework to achieve these policy goals.
The major highlights of the legislation are:

<ul>
<li>The land authority shall distribute the land equally among the landlord and the tenant, thus protecting the land rights of the tenants and dispelling dual ownership over land.	</li>

	<li>Landless squatter families who have no land anywhere in the country and have no economic means to procure a piece of land will be provided with a parcel of land and land title free of cost for one-time up-to a designated size preferably at their original site of informal holding or relocated to any other appropriate site as deemed necessary in case they are currently residing in designated critical areas. The law provides for some restrictions to ensure the family does not become landless again.</li>

	<li>In case of other informal tenure holder residing in government land for more than 10 years and who also have registered land elsewhere in the country, they may be provided with land title for the piece of land up-to a designated size upon payment of levy calculated on the basis of their economic status, residential status, type of land, area of land, land value, duration of the informal landholding, and status of landholding elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<br />
The law demands for a thorough assessment of the persons, families or households and land parcels for the identification, verification and recordation of landless squatters and informal tenure holders, their landholdings and information on different criteria to decide on the amount of levy to be imposed in case of non-landless informal tenure holders. In this process, more work on developing additional rules and regulations, and technical guidelines is necessary. The Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM), a pro-poor, gender responsive, participatory and affordable land information system for capturing person/s to land relationships cognizant of the land rights continuum, has been implemented in Nepal and has proven to be technically sound to generate the information required to implement on the new Land Act.

Since 2013, the Global Land Tool Network within the Land, Housing and Shelter Section of the UN-Habitat has been supporting land reform interventions in Nepal including (i) land policy development and consultations process, (National Land Policy adopted in 2019) and (ii) strategy development for Fit-For-Purpose Land Administration (FFP-LA) and support interventions towards the improvement of earthquake recovery and resilience for affected communities for sustainable and improved livelihoods. Further, the Government of Nepal already has the experiences and lessons learnt from STDM and FFP-LA application in in three settlements of Dholaka district and in the municipalities of Ratnanagar and Belaka.

Congratulations to Nepal on this new land legislation and we look forward to supporting the government of Nepal and stakeholders to scale up their efforts to improve tenure security for all.

3334,4/8/2020 12:45,"In the fight against the pandemic of COVID 19 Government of Nepal imposed nationwide lockdown until April 7. As the crisis started there was scarcity of face masks and sanitizers in the market. In response, there are several initiatives to produce masks at local level by various organizations. However, many of such masks are not up to the quality while availability remain a big question.

UN-Habitat along with the implementing partners of the SWITCH Asia Programme under EU support is trying to come up to contribute to ease the situation. It has two aspects- a) contribute to reduce the scarcity in its project areas and beyond; b) create job for the local communities particularly home-based working women. We are exploring four items for the time being- a) face masks, b) hand sanitizers, c) cooked food supply; and d) PPE. UN-Habitat and partners interacted with health workers of Patan Hospital to standardize the products.

The first item already started producing by the women workers is face mask. Special feature is the mask using non-fabric cotton in-between which can be changed once contaminated. Lalitpur Metropolitan City, Ward No 22, approached the team for the masks to distribute in the communities. The community workers trained in stitching and sewing took this opportunity and produced 500 units on the first day. <em>SABAH-</em>Nepal is leading the work with twelve women from Bungamati and this can be expanded as per the demand.  Of its 600+ workforce now will be mobilized for other items of need. Lumanti, the other partner is ready to mobilize its women cooperative network for similar jobs. They are now focusing on supporting the most needy urban poor families in slum settlements and provide support. As a preparedness planning, UN-Habitat is also working with the partners in producing the required PPE materials which are required in the response measures if the outbreak continues.

3345,4/21/2020 10:13,"GLTN’s Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) has acquired a surprising application in the identification of vulnerable households. A case in point is in Nepal where the GLTN in collaboration with UN-Habitat Nepal Country Office, and its local partner Community Self Reliance Centre (CSRC) have been implementing the “Support to Land Reform Initiatives in Nepal” project.

The Mayor of Belaka Municipality has used the STDM database of annual agriculture produce status as a baseline information to identify the poor and vulnerable families that have lost their wage earnings due to the government lockdown effected as a measure to contain the spread of COVID-19. These families are targeted to benefit from food relief that is being distributed by the government of Nepal in collaboration with other humanitarian grants.

The decision to obtain information from the STDM database for Wards 1 and 3 in Belaka Municipality was arrived at after evaluating the reliability of the data which was revalidated analyzing together with the alternate profession of the Households to be a true indicator of vulnerability. This is because the STDM data under project captures the level of agricultural productivity at the household level and only by using reliable data can the truly deserving households benefit from the food aid. This innovation is a clear reflection of the very huge potential that STDM information sharing can have in combatting the current and any future crises that calls for human geo-spatial data.

In Nepal, UN-Habitat and GLTN are providing technical support in the development of the National Land Policy and application of Fit-For-Purpose land tools, specifically the implementation of the land components of the Constitution. Land to the landless and tenure security for all are the basic thrusts of the land policy which is backed by the recent land legislation and the institutionalization of a land commission. This being a long term objectives, the GLTN support has proved effective in delivery of necessary information in supporting the immediate needs e.g. improvement of earthquake recovery, resilience and tenure security for sustainable livelihoods and the emergency relief efforts in COVID-19.

3352,5/12/2020 10:25,"In the fight against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of Nepal has extended the ongoing nationwide lockdown until 15th April. Since the beginning of the coronavirus spread, face masks and sanitizers are scarce in the market. This has mobilised several local initiatives and organisations to produce masks; however, quality standards and availability remain an issue. 

Through the EU SWITCH-Asia Parya Sampada project, UN-Habitat and implementing partners are joining forces to respond at best to the numerous challenges posed by the COVID-19 spread in Nepal. Actions are being directed mainly towards the production of personal protective equipment (PPE), including protective face masks and hand sanitisers, and providing cooked food supplies in project areas and beyond, where these resources are scarce and rapidly running out. New jobs are also being created for local women home workers.

Working with health workers of the Patan Hospital to standardise protective equipment and products, partners are joining hands with SABAH-Nepal, who is leading the production with twelve local women from Bungamati. In just one day, 500 units have been stitched and sewed. The special feature of these protective masks is the use of in-between non-fabric cotton that can be easily replaced if contaminated. Additional 600 women homeworkers are being mobilised for the production of other items in shortage, and Lumanti, who is a partner in the SWITCH-Asia project, is ready to mobilise its women’s cooperative network to support those most in need, namely, urban poor families in slum settlements. With the launch of this collective initiative, the Lalitpur Metropolitan City, Ward No 22, has approached the project team and ordered masks to distribute to the communities. As part of its preparedness planning, UN-Habitat is working closely with its SWITCH-Asia project partners to produce the required personal protective equipment materials in case the outbreak escalates.

The EU Ambassador to Nepal, H.E. Ms. Veronica Cody said, ""The SWITCH-Asia programme has been in place for many years already, and I’ve had the chance to visit several of its projects. It is a cross-border initiative in Asia to encourage and promote governments and private sector to switch to greener, environmentally sustainable production and consumption practices. SWITCH-Asia promotes energy efficiency, waste reduction and improved use of recycled and raw materials, which is good for the environment and saves money. In the current pandemic, we are examining our EU projects to see how we can re-purpose or re-direct them, to address both the health and economic impacts of the Coronavirus. This is just one example of re-directing a SWITCH-Asia programme to meet the needs of the Nepali people, both from a health aspect, in the design of re-usable masks, but also in offering employment to those who need it most.  Stay healthy, stay safe!""

The facilities at the four vegetable markets are visited by over 10,000 customers and vendors daily. The market management groups of the small scale vegetable vendors are promoting social distancing, mask wearing and handwashing for the safety of the visitors.

“We had never heard of COVID-19 but now it is living with us. Handwashing facilities not only keep us safer but help stop the stigma against slum dwellers,” said Bhagwati Adhikari, Secretary, Nepal Mahila Ekta Samaj, a women's association for those living in the informal settlements.

The ‘Water for Life Project’ is supported mainly by the people of Fukuoka, Japan. Communities were in the forefront in selecting sites, deciding the management plan, managing the water, refilling the liquid soap regularly and ensuring the safe discharge of wastewater.

Communities, mainly women, came together to form a management committee that takes care of the hand washing facility and sanitation provisions for their communities.

“Returning home from outside we never know what we bring with us. This facility helps to keep our neighbourhood safe as we do not have running water in each house,” said Bimala Lama, Chairperson, Nepal Mahila Ekta Samaj.

UN-Habitat has been promoting hand washing from more than a decade in support of Nepal’s  national sanitation campaign.  UN-Habitat is also installing handwashing facilities in 64 rural municipalities targeting 1.4 million people.

Immediately after the COVID-19 lockdown, the UN-Habitat led project, Parya Sampada, was repurposed to support women in the project area to make face masks and other personal protective equipment. The project, which is funded by the Switch-ASIA Programme of European Union, provided raw materials and skill trainings.

“My source of livelihood has completely stopped since the lockdown. I would have been left with no income if Parya Sampada project of UN Habitat had not initiated and provided me with the opportunity to produce emergency safety gear items during this pandemic,” said one of the informal settlement workers, Bidhya Narkami, who had lost her work due to the pandemic.

Bidhya is working with 13 other members from the Bungamati community,to produce the face masks and other material.

 “If this situation persists with no income generation activities, it will be very difficult for us to bounce back to our normal life after the lockdown” she said. “We don’t have control over what is happening so everyone should join hands together to provide opportunities and plans.”
